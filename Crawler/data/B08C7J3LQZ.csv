We're not past this nonsense yet?Sigh.Here's the short, spoiler free version of this review: The Next Wife has decent writing competency for the genre (this isn't an insult, by the way), acceptable plot... and really insulting stereo types.Now, abandon all hope of avoiding spoilers, ye who continue reading...Stereotype problem #1: The WomenApparently, women are the worst. They are conniving witches with a ""b"" who conspire to trap and/or murder poor, innocent, wildly wealthy men who are just trying to have their entitled midlife crisis in peace.I understand that suspense stories, by their very nature, feature bad people and unlikeable characters. That's a feature, not a bug. But the cliched pitting of all female characters against each other is tiresome. They don't all need to compete over the same rich man. It's dull. He is not that special. He's just some boring rich dude.Stereotype #2 (LOOK AWAY THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE): Abuse Victims Become Sociopathic MurderersThis one really makes me want to smash something. Authors, do NOT do this. Do NOT make childhood abuse victims who defend themselves from their abusers into people who, later in life, basically commit murder just for fun and cash. This is lazy and insulting to abuse victims. You're creative; you can do better.Stereotype #3: The Poors Are Out to Kill YouMy lord, can everyone stop using this? Every non-rich person in this book is a conniving, lying, untrustworthy, and murderous piece of garbage. AND they're probably southern! Yikes!Sure, some of the Richie Rich types are murder-y, too, but at least they have taste and style and aren't disgustingly yucky and poor.Conclusion:I love suspense novels. I love unlikeable, bad-people characters. But I'm heartily sick of these lazy characterizations of women and poor people and abuse victims. Do better, authors and publishers. It's 2021.",The perfect book if you despise abuse victims and poor people,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I only got a couple of chapters in, and I had no interest in finishing it. The main character was just far too obnoxious, self-absorbed and catty for my taste. I didn't want to put up with her for however many more pages. There's a way to create a protagonist who isn't likable but also inspires you to keep reading. This was not the way. I'm an avid reader, and I can count on only one hand how many books I refuse to finish. This book has now been added to that hand. Not worth my time or effort to read.

58 people found this helpful,Judith D. Collins,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021","I adored THE NEXT WIFE —a deliciously evil cat-and-mouse twisty game between the first wife (Kate), and the second wife (Tish), and the daughter (Ashlyn). John (husband) does not have a clue what he is in for!Let the power play games begin! One wife is street smart, the other is business smart. Which one will win in the end?Gosh, I would LOVE to see this play out on a TV series or movie. I can see Billy Bob Thornton (Goliath-love this show) as Tish's attorney (Uncle George Price) and must think on who would make the best star for Bob, Kate's attorney, as well as for Kate, Tish, John, and Ashlyn.Kate has the brains and she and hubby have built EventCo from the ground up. They started the company fifteen years ago and it has grown to become one of Central Ohio's most prominent and well-respected companies. From party planning, events, supplies, tickets, they have it all and now they are going public. They have worked well together for years, but now there is some tension.Around three years earlier, John (CEO) a little bored with his life, a wife who works all the time, and problem daughter, goes through a mid-life crisis and turns to his gold-digging, psycho, manipulative administrative assistant (Tish) from Kentucky (twenty years younger).Growing up poor, with a troubled childhood, Tish wants to grab a rich man and live the good life and to hell with whom she destroys along the way.Soon John loses his mind and falls for the gold-digger, materialistic woman, and heaven forbid marries her. They have the big house in Ohio, and also one in Telluride and Ponte Vedra Beach, FL (yes, I lived there too, and forgot your mom does, Kaira, nice play).Tish tries to come between first wife and daughter, but she really is too selfish and self-centered to care about anyone but herself. This IPO thing has gotten John stressed and he begins turning back toward Kate. He did not realize what he had. But will his wife have him back?Kate will allow no one to destroy her company and will do anything to protect it. She has her own plan.John, Kate, and Ashlyn are sneaking in texts and secret meetings because Tish is very jealous. She monitors his every move. She cannot have anyone taking up John's time. She is much younger and thinks she is the center of his world. She is a piece of work and Kaira has the best one-liners.However, now she feels she is losing him, and threatened. Always checking his phone, and watching his every move, so she will not lose him back to his first wife. Now the daughter seems to be on the mom's side.So she decides to whisk him away to Telluride to their condo for the weekend. John does not have time and she pressures him with a romantic weekend. John has some heart problems and the altitude and stress he has been going through during the IPO and his high blood pressure, may not be in his best interest.But Tish has a plan. This plan will not be in John's best interest. Better watch those margaritas!John does not want to cause a scene and if he can just wait until they leave and he gets back to the office, then he can get rid of Tish. But Tish has something else in mind. No one crosses her with the help of her sleazy attorney.However, Tish does not know what Kate (the first wife is capable of). Never underestimate the first wife.What FUN! Between Tish, Kate, and Ashlyn, these three women will make you laugh out loud. What a wild ride! The Nelson women are ready for a fight. Which one will win in the end? I loved the smart house, app, and how Ashlyn screws with Tish.Kaira Rouda's books are always highly entertaining and she always has some tricks up her sleeve but leaves some hints along the way. I could not put this one down and plan to lose sleep. Her characterizations and their thoughts are off the chart bloody good.Cleverly written, Rouda fans will devour this one and new fans alike. I have read all her books and each is a heck of a wicked devious ride! Move this to the top of your list.

47 people found this helpful,Cid Herman,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2021","WELL. ...that was disappointing!THE NEXT WIFE was a truly disappointing read for a number of reasons. First, and most importantly is the shallow plot. There isn't a lot going on here, other than the petty internal thoughts of some stereotypical ""mean girls"". There are only three main characters and there is very little to distinguish them from each other. They all act like spoiled entitled brats with very little to endear them to the reader. When you don't like anyone, it is hard to relate to them, or even care what happens to them.There is very little action in the story. Most of it is revenge fantasies and musings that take place in the minds of the juvenile characters. Not a lot happens here, and what does, is contrived and entirely too coincidental.Last point: this book, and stories like it perpetuate unflattering stereotypes about women, their relationships with each other, their dependency on men, their lack of intelligence, pettiness and a whole host of others.Stear clear of this one!",Steer clear of this one!,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

I eagerly dove in ... and quickly regretted it.I love satire, parodies, wicked characters, and humor ... when done well. This story and the characters are so cliched, so predictable, so silly, so eye-rolling, so cringe. The scenes are outlandish, the dialogue embarrassing. It’s not ironic, it’s not sarcastic — it’s a beat-you-over-the-head with the obvious, page after page. And character development? Look elsewhere, there’s none here ... these “people” are nothing but seething envy, anger, resentment, hatred, and viciousness disguised as characters. They do nothing in the entire book except try to destroy each other, soap opera style. I didn’t care what happened to any of them. Why would I? They’re cardboard cutouts straight from the TV show “Dynasty”. All that was missing was a ‘hair pulling fight and tumble into the swimming pool while wearing diamonds and ball gowns’ scene. At least that show was campy fun.I did finish it, though, and am mad at myself for wasting the time. I wish I’d chosen the other book I was looking at instead. I can’t figure out the author’s motivation for writing such a ridiculous book. This story is as old as the beginning of time: women fighting over a man. Yawn.

3 people found this helpful,Sally Schmidt,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2021","To say The Next Wife is an exciting read is a vast understatement. It’s non-stop thrills, guesses and surprises. The description alone hooked me, and once I read the first chapter I knew I was destined for an all-night read. I could not stop.Tish. At the start, Tish just seems like the typical younger woman at the office who hooks the older boss who’s having a midlife crisis. Not too likeable but not too surprising. Yes, she’s young, maybe just a bit too young emotionally. She’s won the husband, the job, the house, the money, ousted the first wife and was great friends with the daughter in the early days. But Tish isn’t really the typical second wife, things are just a little off with her. Tish doesn’t just have desire, or yearning or need. What she has is more like rapacious craving. She is determined to have what she wants, and if there is one thing Tish does not lack, it’s confidence. In her looks, her strength of will, and her ability to get her own way. And John starting to pull away, to express some regret at leaving first wife Kate, to display some rebellion against Tish’s rules to keep him isolated, the suspected sneaking around with Kate behind her back, isn’t going to cut it with Tish. Nope. No way. She did not escape her terrible, terribly poor youth to start making concessions now.John. Here’s a guy who thought he knew what he wanted and went after it without hesitation. But after three years, this I-finally-found-the-love-of-my-life thing with Tish doesn’t seem quite so lovely. He misses Kate and is now using every business opportunity he can to be with and communicate with her, he misses his former closeness with his daughter and chafes at Tish trying to maneuver them apart. But he’s exhausted from work, has a heart condition, and doesn’t feel well.Kate. Or should I say Poor Kate. Built this business from the ground up, side by side with husband John, sacrificed a lot, including a close relationship with their daughter Ashlyn, working long, long hours to focus on the firm. And then John meets his soul mate – ugh – and as if personally embarrassing and humiliating Kate in front of their staff isn’t enough, he delays the release of her latest invention until the IPO is launched. As I said, poor Kate. No husband, a daughter who is often distant, and the business she loves invaded by Tish sashaying around. But Kate is no more the typical first wife than Tish is the typical second wife. Kate is strong, controlling, iron-willed and there’s not just heartbreak and loss there, there is smoldering anger.Ashyln is the poor little rich girl. Privileged childhood but a mother with not enough time for her growing up, her home and family disrupted by Tish and her rules and manipulations. She’s an intern at the firm and wants her family and family business back together like it once was. She resents Tish and misses her dad.The focus shifts around between the four of them and it at first seems clear what they think, know and plan to do. But it’s not clear. Their words and thoughts are unsettling and maybe not so obvious after all. There are too many delicious twists and turns to reveal them here without spoilers. Something unexpected occurred early in the book and I was happily left playing catch up from that point.The Next Wife is one of the Amazon First Reads for April 2021 and I am happy I selected it. The plot is smooth and fast-moving, full of uncertainty, danger and suspense, the characters multi-layered and interesting if not always likeable, and everything is expertly brought together for a very satisfying conclusion.

It was listed as a ""psychological thriller,"" which I usually enjoy. It was not at all thrilling. The characters were written as caricatures with very little nuance or depth, which is necessary for a psychological thriller to keep the reader guessing. One character was written as 100% good and the other 100% bad, so it was obvious that the script would get flipped at some point. I kept reading because I really thought there would be a bomb dropped and it would get interesting.

I don't think she knew how to trust anyone enough to really make friends. Then to find out it was Kate who actually slowly killed her husband, I just didn't see hat coming. Wow, what a story!",Fantastic read.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Foster,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2021","This was a fun romp through the lives of Kate (the first wife) and Tish (the next) trophy wife and much younger woman. It's a battle through corporate America as Kate and Tish battle over the company Kate and her husband founded. Throw in Kate's college-aged daughter who used to be friends with Tish but of course loves her mother...and when tragedy strikes, everything blows up.

I loved the way the author was able to create characters that you “love to hate.” From the first page, the glimpse into the mind of “the next wife” shows a perspective that makes us cringe. At least me. I did not like Tish at all. But I loved the author’s mastery at showing precisely what this woman was all about in just a few paragraphs. It was similar with the other characters, especially the female ones—the previous wife and the daughter from that first marriage. If you enjoy books that provide deep characterization into both likable and unlikable complex characters, you will probably enjoy this book. If you don't enjoy books where you follow characters who are inherently unlikeable (and perhaps even evil), this book will most likely not be for you.

I only took a brief look at the blurb, so wasn't prepared for the multi POV aspect to the tale, or the shades of grey, or the double crossing and conniving and scheming, but it was well done, with the by-line of the female of the species being more deadly than the male.I think John needed to be a slightly stronger character to have inspired so many different feelings in these three women, but that was pretty much my only gripe with the tale. I had to admire, I suppose is the word, each female to differing degrees, and tbh, the Kate twist was pretty well done. The country hick second wife and her sociopathy was a little stereotypical of a woman on the make having a reason for it, but she went into every chosen relationship with an agenda and was prepared to do what it took, so I had no sympathy for where she ended up.
