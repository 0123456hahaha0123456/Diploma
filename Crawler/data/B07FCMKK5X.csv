Instead of being solid black like every other SD card I've seen, it looked like a green circuit board with a strange black square on it.Second red flag was the MUCH lower than advertised read/write speeds (only 50-55 write with mid 80s read).Third red flag was when I tried to copy data from my old sd card on to this one. I was able to get about 21.5 GB of data on to it until it unmounted itself from my computer. I then physically removed the card and inserted it back in the computer. Windows recommended that I repair the drive, so I did. After that, I go and try to copy the data again and it unmounted itself, just like before. I tried the same thing by repairing the drive, except this time, Windows informs me that it could not be repaired!

"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2019",319 people found this helpful,"Anyone claiming that the green backed microsdxc cards are fake needs to do better research. In all of Sandisk's marketing, they show a green backed microsd with the ""XC"" instead of ""HC"". In all reviews from reputable websites show the same.Secondly, anyone complaining about how there is missing storage doesn't understand how marketing of high capacity storage media works. They calculate size based on 1000 kilobyte per megabyte not 1024 kilobyte per megabyte. If you bought the 128GB model, your device would see it as 119GB because your device calculates it as 1024KB per 1MB. It's been done this way for decades.Here's a list of most of the capacities that SanDisk sells with their corresponding ""actual"" size.32GB = 29.8023GB64GB = 59.6046GB128GB = 119.2093GB256GB = 238.4186GB400GB = 372.529GB1TB = 931.3226GBWhen you buy a hard drive, you also don't get the full capacity for the same reason.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019",102 people found this helpful,"""1TB Micro SDXC Memory Cards"" have been sold online for a handful of years now, by companies with strange, made-up-sounding names like Jojlon, Winston, or Krrttphfff. However, until the SanDisk 1TB Micro SD hit the market this year, every single one of those sellers advertising a 1TB Micro SD card were lying. If you read the comments section of those items (yes, you can still find the bogus, scamming, way-smaller-than-advertised micro SD cards being sold on this website TODAY!) you will see them filled with dissatisfied customers, claiming they were gypped and posting the screenshots of their benchmark software results to prove it. Now, because of this storied history of scammers specifically using this website, and other like it, claiming to sell high-capacity microSD cards, but in reality hocking crappy cards made in China that are, at best, 1/10th the size of what they claim to be, I suspect that a large numbers of the tech-oriented crowd will come across the item in question today: the SanDisk 1TB Extreme microSDKC UHS-I Memory Card (C10, U3, V30, 4K, A2... blah blah blah blah). If a significant percentage of the people who consider purchasing this item get cold feet and back out, due to the aforementioned rampant scamming occurring at the hands of sellers advertising *VERY* large capacity microSD cards, THAT WOULD BE A SHAME!I had significant doubts about the product myself, due to my calculation that there was a high probability this was yet another scam by online rip-off artists. However, I reeeeeeally needed a microSD card bigger than 512GB, for my cell phone. I have juuust about 650GB of high-res music (a lot of DSD files, for example) which I like to carry around in my phone, and this meant that, for me, the highest-capacity-microsd card-available-to-date, the 512GB, simply wouldn't cut it. I saw the 1TB SanDisk appear on Amazon a week or so ago, but it was not yet available for purchase. Then, a few days ago it officially became available for purchase, and I immediately paid the $450 and, thanks to Prime, selected FREE One-Day Shipping for it.The next day, after I received it in the mail, I immediately put it in the USB adapter it came with, plugged it in to a USB 3.0 slot on my laptop and oppened CrystalDiskMark6, followed by ATTO Disk Benchmark, and, one by one, tested the capabilities of this microSD card. The card's manufacturer claimed 160MB/s read speeds, and 90MB/s write speeds. I guessed the card would not live up to those claims, as in my experience cards almost never live up to their manufacturer's claims about their capabilities. So what were my results? You can check them out yourself from the pictures I uploaded.First, the CrystalDiskMark6 tests:At the 50MB size and 1GB size for the test file, for reading speed the card actually reached the manufacturer's stated speed (nearly), and then outperformed that speed on the second test, while on the writing test the card excelled above the manufacturer's advertised speeds. Specifically, during the Seq Q32T1 test, the card Read speed was 147.2MB/s and 166.1MB/s for the 50MiB and 1GiB test file sizes, respectively. The Write speed was 103.4MB/s and 104.6MB/s, respectively! That's a shock, for me, I was NOT expecting a card to actually live up to, and then SURPASS a manufacturers claims.NOTE: the third CrystalDiskMark6 test results are much less impressive. ""What happened there?"" you might ask. Well, if you take a close look you'll see the test file size in that case is 32GB. Thats GIGABYTES. 32GB is the largest test file size the program can do, its maxed out at that point. Considering the mechanics of how microSD cards work, the concepts of allocation unit size, etc, its no surprise at all that the card failed to perform well with a test file size of 32GB. MicroSD cards were simply not meant to be used as devices with allocated unit sizes of such a significant size. Its an unrealistic and useless test, that does not help convey any relevant information about the product. I only included it to show the full range of test results obtained from both extremes and the average of the variables available for users of CrystalDiskMark6 to alter.Second, the ATTO Disk Benchmark test results. Above I have listed sequentially the transfer rate results for the card with test file sizes of 64MB, then 128MB and 256MB, all expressed in bytes, and the transfer rate results for the card with test file sizes of 64MB, then 128MB and 256MB expressed as inputs and outputs. Again, we see that the card, at its best, is able to consistently reach Read speeds of approximately 160MB/s, and, I'm happy to report, Write speeds consistently touching 100MB/s! Or VERY close to it, anyways. The point is its significantly above the stated 90MB/s claimed by the manufacturer.All in all, I'm happy. After testing the card and putting it through the proverbial wringer I feel it lives up to and surpasses my expectations in terms of its performance and capabilities. I have now put about 600GB of data, mostly music files, onto the cards and it works flawlessly so far. I have not yet had any issues with file corruption, and the item seems to be durably manufactured. It also comes with a free backup/rescue program download, called RescuePro Deluxe, so that's a nice addition.TAKEAWAY: If you have the need for a microSD card larger than 512GB, and you can afford the $450 sticker price, GO FOR IT.You can keep an eye on this review, if I have any problems with the card in the future I will add my critique at the bottom as an ""EDIT:""",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The Only Legit 1TB Micro SDXC Card on the Market, and Best of All, It's Up To Spec",jbain

"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2019",49 people found this helpful,"When I first reviewed this card I assumed I had received a fake or defective card, because the performance it delivered was SLOWER than my older SanDisk A1 rated micro SD cards. However, that doesn't seem to be the case...Further research in collaboration with others seems to have unlocked a dirty little secret about these new A2 rated cards. They are actually SLOWER than A1 cards unless you have an A2 certified device, and there are almost none of those available at this time.SanDisk won't openly admit this when contacted about the less than stellar performance, but they keep pushing you to buy their specific Mobilemate USB 3.0 card reader, which may be the only (or at least one of the very few) A2 certified devices available at the time of this review.Now to be clear I wasn't expecting the maximum advertised performance. Even though my A1 rated SanDisk cards all met or exceeded their advertised specs, I was pretty sure that A2 cards would require newer hardware to achieve their lofty numbers, but I was expecting them to exceed the performance of the much less expensive A1 cards. They do not! While they are faster than your typical Class-10 card, they are slower than A1 rated cards, and that's something you won't find in any documentation.The only test that was faster on this A2 card was sequential write, and since I was comparing an ""Extreme"" to an ""Ultra"" card, that was to be expected. In every other performance category the A1 card was faster. Multiple tests were run on multiple devices, and while the numbers varied between devices, the results were consistent. Sequential read and both read and write IOPS were 10-15% faster on the A1 card, and IOPS is the main reason you'd even want an A2 card!If you are upgrading from a regular Class-10 card this will be much faster, but so will a less expensive A1 card, and you probably won't notice the difference, so why spend more?If your intended device isn't ""A2"" certified, buyer beware.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Dirty little secret about A2 cards,TinyZombie

"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2019",27 people found this helpful,"I got this card for my galaxy S9. It had a very good chip installed in it before (Samsung 256G Evo Select) which I liked. But I wanted to max out my S9 both in its 400G max capacity and in the speed to record. This chip/card does record 1080p 60fps with no problems at all. It also does 4k video well. (I tested it in one of my cameras.)The only place it fails is when I'm doing rapid burst pictures in my phone. The camera says it can't do rapid burst when using an external card and switches burst control over to internal memory automatically. But to be fair the Samsung chip I had did that too. So apparently it's something built into the camera app or S9 hardware path that just assumes no external chip can do it, even though both the original Samsung 256G and this even higher spec Sandisk 400G are top of the line spec wise. Not really a problem for me as I don't generally take bursts of photos but mentioned it here in case you do. Frankly, if I needed that, I would get an SLR camera instead of using my phone.When I tried this memory in my Sony video camera, (which is only supposed to support 256G), it saw all 400G and it worked flawlessly and I filled it with combinations of pictures and videos.I also tested this card as an external chip in a USB 3.1 adapter with my computer. It showed 155MB/s read and 88MB/s write at 64k transfer sizes for a duration of its entire 400G. That's close enough to its listed max speed and I'm happy with that. Now you need to understand, that's testing with all conditions being nearly perfect for this chip. It's highly unlikely to perform that good in the real world moving your data around. I noticed that if you go below 64k file transfer sizes or don't use high speed ports like USB 3, you see much less speed. Most newer cameras and phones will best utilize the higher speeds. But if you use this card with older SD adapters or USB 2.x or computer SD card readers you'll be disappointed with any fast SD memory card. ALL the pathways through adapters and ports and cables and hardware have to support the higher speeds or testing will just show you the top speed of the weakest link in your data pathway.But let me tell you this card is amazingly fast to copy files to or from if you have the proper equipment to support it!When I got this chip, I first removed my Samsung 256G and installed this card instead (blank). Although it showed up right away as 400G in the S9 phone, I had the phone reformat it anyway as I just like to be sure its setup by the particular device before testing.I then used a USB3.1 adapter to plug the phone into a USB3.1 port on my computer. I already had done driver setups for this phone before.I decided to fill the 400G card with music videos and some personal videos and my docs and my sound files and music. I setup a single copy from the PC to phone external memory of about 340G. (The card actually formats to 367 computer G even though that's 400G of real memory.) Last time I did 256G like this, it took me few hours to complete. So I started the copy to the phone and walked away thinking I'd come back in several hours or if I heard an error beep. I did notice it was copying files fast.After about an hour and 15 minutes, I heard a bleep from the computer saying it was done. I was a bit frustrated because I thought I was hearing an error beep. So I began to check where in the copy had died. What I discovered was, it really had copied all 340G in 1.25 hours! I couldn't believe it and rechecked to see all the files were indeed there! That's including almost 200,000 photo files that usually slow down backups or restorals to a crawl. Never had a write of major data speeds be so fast!So in case you can't tell by now, I love this card in my Galaxy S9 phone. I was happy with the Samsung 256G memory card but thrilled even more by this Sandisk 400G upgrade in speed and storage size. Granted, I have 6TB of media storage alone on my PC that I'll never get all of on a phone. But now, thanks to this card, I've got all my docs, sound files, music videos, and unwatched videos ready to watch on the phone. Couldn't be much happier with this Sandisk 400G Extreme microSD card.One thing you should be aware of though is you will definitely use your device battery up quicker with this card installed. It sucks my Samsung Galaxy S9+ battery down about 40% faster the the 64G internal memory by itself. But even then, it still stays up most of the day and night before charging. Of course if you do a lot of copying or moving files, it's likely to last slightly less without recharging.Update December 2020:This card is still working great for me and it was transfered to my new LG Wing phone.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020",4 people found this helpful,"I haven't had good luck with Sandisk micro SD cards. I haven't had any failures but these are my two issues:1. On large file transfers - more than 1gb - Sandisk tends to overheat and lose transfer speed. This is worse writing TO the card than reading from it. Transfer speeds are stil ok, but nothing like the speeds I get from my USB 3.1 port with a thumbdrive. Several years ago the problem was so severe my files got corrupted even when the on-board thermal protection was throttling my transfer speeds down to 5-10 megabytes per second. In the past two years data loss has ceased to be a problem, and the speed hit on large file transfers is much less severe, although Samsung continues to run faster, in real life big file transfers, than San Disk, at least for me.2. I don't think Sandisk really meets the specs required for ""extendable"" or ""unified"" storage on Android, that or it throttles so early the perfomance on small, constant file reads and writes suffers more than it should. I almost always get an error message with their A1 cards on budget (Qualcom 42x chipset) phones complaining the storage is slow and hence not optimal as unified storage. I haven't gotten this error message with my two Fire HD 10 9th gen tablets on this latest A2 iteration, however, which may be a function of the chipsets and memory controller used in these tablets or maybe the upgrade from A1 to A2 makes a difference.I purchased two Fire HD 10's, 2020 editions/9th gen (the second one purchased on Prime Day for just $80, which is insanely cheap) and two of these A2 class Sandisk 128gb micro SD cards.A2 means the memory controller built into the micro SD card should be fast enough to run apps (not gaming apps!) from the card, not just read storage data.The real challenge is for app-rated (A1 or A2) card to handle data reads and writes for multiple apps at the same time. ""Same time"" is critical - it's not reading a single big file that creates problems for micro SD cards, it's reading small files at nearly the same time to handle the needs of multiple apps running at the same time. The way to avoid any performance issues is to NOT allow the operating system to ""move"" apps from true internal storage to the SD card. Only data.The first 128gb drive installed perfectly easily in my first Fire as ""portable"" or ""removable"" storage but that is not surprising. The second card was installed as ""internal storage"" in the second Fire glitched several times, crashing once, and not recognized by the tablet as storage at all. I don't know what I finally did to get past the glitches. but as far as I can tell what finally worked was first formatting it as ""portable"" storage first, rthen ebooting, then re-formatting it as ""internal"" storage.I was ""offered"" a chance to move some apps onto the SD card after formatting as internal storage. DO NOT do this - the 32gb of internal, faster storage is a much better place to run apps from, not the SD card even though it is A2 ""app-friendly"" classified. All CONTENT will automatically go to the SD card in the future, such as downloaded Netflix and Prime Videos.Pay attention to the following issues which might develop:1. Simultaneously downloading videos or other content AND watching a previously stored video. This can tax the memory controller in the SD card since essentially the device is attempting to read your video and write your downloading episodes at the same time (subject to buffering). It shouldn't be a problem,but it might. I usually download content when I'm not using the tablet.2. Moving lots of content from external storage - like a thumb drive - to internal storage. The process is ALWAYS a lot faster going from USB 3 thumbdrives to internal factory storage, and slower when writing to the SD card.In my review title I mentioned I prefer Samsung. Without doubt they make more dependable SD cards that more consistently ""hit"" their specs and don't throttle down as much on large file transfers. However, Sandisk pretty much ""owns"" the A1 and A2 ""app friendly"" micro SD space, and they frequently go on sale. Since they no longer ""corrupt"" large file transfers (I'm talking about moving a 30gb music collection to an SD card in a computer, not just a couple of gb), I no longer avoid Sandisk like the plague. Still, as they say, once burned twice wary.I'm hunting for reviews from Raspberry Pi users. Running an actual operating system from a micro SD card is equally hard, or harder, than running Android apps. So far, the micro SD cards recommend for those Raspberry Pi systems are NOT A1 or A2 class or even necessarily ""faster"" micro SD cards - apparently speed on larger files doesn't necessarily correlate to the speed required for smaller, constant file transfers that an operating system needs.It's good to see micro SD card prices become so low and commodity-like. I can remember when cards were a dollar a gigabyte, or much more. For under $20 I'm more than willing to give this Sandisk A2 128gb micro SD card a workout in my Fire HD 10 9th gen.I'm also a little surprised to see all the new brand names. I'm used more to Samsung and Sandisk at the top, with Kensington, Patriot, etc. as the next tier. My guess is Chinese subcontractor factories feel less bound to have a long-standing brand name and are just going direct to market.

Anytime we see one 64GB+ that falls to an amazing price (for now, this one at around $8.99-$9.99 is the best we have seen), we wind up snagging it for our collection so that we never run out.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Rest assured that these cards perform as advertised. If your speeds vary, its perfectly natural. What's advertised are the card's TOP speeds, and what speed it reaches in practice depends on on your setup, including the computer used to test the cards, the methods used to test the cards, the methods used to plug it into your PC, and various other factors.The most important thing for you to worry about is getting a fake card. I have NEVER, EVER gotten a fake card through Amazon. Make sure you buy from the right product page and from the right seller, and you will never have issues. If your product page is the official one (which this one is) and you buy it NEW from Sandisk's actual store, shipped with Prime Shipping (if you're a member) from Amazon.com (the main offer on this page, currently), then you will NEVER get a fake card. It DOES NOT MATTER if other available sellers are shipped from Amazon.com; they are NOT Sandisk, and they are NOT Amazon themselves. Amazon's only job in that situation is to store and ship the product that seller is providing, NOT to open up the box to see if its fake. They are only responsible for items THEY are selling. On any product page, if Amazon is NOT the seller of the item, then its up to you to know who you are buying from and if you can trust them. In this case, if you buy from Sandisk, you will get the real product every single time, plain and simple.These high capacity 512gb cards are supposed to have a little junk in their trunk, by the way. The little black bulges on the rear of these cards should be more comforting than alarming. Also, you WILL have access to less than 512gb of space. A small portion of every single card or storage device is taken up with things that help the card function, and the rest is given to you for storage. The larger a card or storage device is, the bigger this invisible part of the card usually has to be. Having access to all 512gb of space would give the card no space to actually function. (In fact, if your card lists 512gb of available space, that's probably a red flag that you may have a fake card lying about its capacity)If you suspect you have a fake card, try filling it up with junk. If it creates problems during the transfer, its probably fake. If it says that you were able to fill it up successfully, try opening various files on the card to see if they open. If they don't open, you probably have a fake card on your hands. You can also use some of the numerous free testing tools available to check your card, like ""Check Flash"" or ""FakeFlashTest"".

However when using ANYTHING else, the scores are underwhelming...that speaks more to the lack of quality of most USB MicroSD card readers then the MicroSD cards themselves.I got this card originally for my Raspberry Pi, so I didnt go for a 128gb card because its not really needed for a Raspberry Pi certainly not with the projects im using it for. The Pi ran pretty well on it, but as time passed and I looked into benchmarking, I took it out of my Pi, cleared it and benchmarked. I have seen quite a few benchmarks from people running an older version of Crystal Diskmark then me and with a 128GB card that performed as advertised spec-wise...but my benchmark tests were a bit underwhelming, my suspect is the adapter so I will be buying a USB 3.2 adapter and see how that goes, I just hope it works for all cards and not just the cards of the brand who makes the adapter. I tested all of the following methods on 2 different computers both using USB 3.1 Gen 1 SS ports, with a USB 3.1 card reader(Transcend USB 3.1 Gen 1) which has shown in the reviews of it here on amazon to benchmark around the same as my results show, nothing above 95mb/s, so I do believe its bottlenecked at the adapter.

All the other capacities I own look the same except the 512 (32, 64, 200 Ultra, 400 Extreme).As for the actual performance, it does read & write fast in my phone. That said, I'm on the fence on whether it is really worth the extra A2 speed inside my cellphone. I realized I'm mostly using this for storage, but occasionally record 4k videos which never reaches 50 Mbps write to the micro SD. Until my internal storage is stuffed full of apps I'm going to keep them on the 10x quicker internal memory, meaning the A2 rating doesn't apply. My use case may not allow this card to fully shine, yet I wasn't sure the Ultra series was quick enough on the write.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019",2 people found this helpful,"Note that I'm writing this review in Aug 2019. If you're reading it in 2020+ you are probably laughing at how pitifully small the capacity is of this card, however at the time of writing, the 1TB cards hadn't shipped at reasonable prices and this is a lot more affordable than the 512GB card.So I really like Sandisk. They do good things with flash memory and this card is no exception. It's fast, reliable and of course compatible. However be aware, some electronics may not work correctly with the larger capacity. I bought this for a GoPro Hero6, their web site says a v30 Sandisk Ultra card >=32GB is supported, however this will not work correctly. Apparently they decided that 256GB is the biggest card that will be made. Even their Hero 7 only supports the smaller cards. This is obviously not the fault of Sandisk, Gopro is not keeping up with the times, which is sad and will probably hurt them in the long run due to competition. So double check the max capacity supported by your device before you buy, because some electronics vendors are slow and/or lazy and haven't caught up to the current capacities.For my Samsung phone and other camera (non-Gopro) devices, there is no problem with 400GB of storage. if you need this much storage, this is an excellent option.BTW, this card does work to record 4K60FPS on the Gopro Hero6 Black, so you can use it, the camera just won't play the video back on the camera's screen, the camera locks up and needs to have the battery pulled. If I use the GoPro Quik software to transfer it to my computer (Mac) it works fine, so it's clearly a bug in the camera software. 4K24 does work correctly on camera, just not 4K30 or 4K60.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I've got this card for a total of $250 (Tax amount added to it) when it was on sale for 12% off saving $30 and a free fast 2-day shipping too from Amazon prime membership. I bought this mainly for my Nintendo Switch console so that I don't have to switch SD cards back and forth for my digital downloaded Nintendo Switch games. I have the first edition of Nintendo Switch bought from 2017 (Not the new Nintendo Switch from 2019, the first one from 2016/2017 with a person's hand logo on the original box) and I can confirm that it 100% works for the Nintendo Switch console. I'm 100% sure it will work on the new Nintendo Switch from 2019 too since that version from Nintendo is the updated/better version of the Switch (You can look it up Google search if you're unsure of the 2 different varieties of Nintendo Switch consoles.) If you plan on moving your saved game data files from the old SD card to this newer one, make sure you watch some YouTube videos first on how to save the old backup save data files and then inserting it into the newer SD card before installing the newer card to your Switch. If you want to use it on a brand new Nintendo Switch, then I would suggest just inserting in the SD card after you've finished going through the installation process of setting up your new Nintendo Switch console. After inserting in the SD card, it will ask to auto system update to where it will restart your Nintendo Switch. Once you've done that, you can go to the Data Management next in System Settings and see your Nintendo Switch with this new 1TB SD card being installed to it having a total of 920~ GB of space which is pretty good considering I have over 35+ digital downloaded games and apps. I still have over 700+ GB of space left after redownloading all of my games back from the Nintendo eShop.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"In short this is a great card and it's speed falls close to it's advertised speeds. ADVERTISED ACTUALREAD: 160 MB/s 149 MB/s (93.13% of advertised speed)WRITE: 90 MB/s 109 MB/s (121.11% of advertised speed)The results above are from the SanDisk Extreme 128 GB card, SDSQXA1-128G-GN6MA bought in Q1 of 2021.Unfortunately, there are MANY fake SanDisk cards on the market everywhere and they can be very problematic if bought and used. I highly suggest you test ANY sd card that you buy. In general, I always want to get at least 90% of claimed speeds. Different hardware or software optimizations can make it to where you may not get speeds as high as claimed, but if you are close to them, close is good enough.Only read on if you are researching SD cards and verification or are just a nerdy person like myself.When looking up SD cards it's important to keep a few things in mind:* Investigate the claims for speed if it is important to you. The card may say xxx MB/s write speed* That asterisk may reference that the speed is only guaranteed when using a certain software. Since you might be like me and installing the card into a phone, that phone will most likely not use that software so the speeds will be lower. For a more real-world speed, look at reviews who have verified the speeds either in the device that you plan to use it in, or by other software to benchmark it.* Always test the speed of the card once you get it (The speeds above come from a program known as H2testw)* Always test the storage capacity of the card.* I highly recommend that you test your card using H2testw. It tests the two most important things about your storage: actual speeds, and actual storage. Fake or faulty cards cannot hit their advertised speeds. Fake cards often are edited to report a false storage to your computer. Say you buy a 128GB card and you read the size in Windows, 119 GB. Seems close enough right? Well this is not a guarantee of the real storage capacity. The card could be a 4 GB card that is written to report itself as 119 GB. For the first 4 GB of space or so there will be no issues with the card, aside from likely slow speeds, since fake cards often use slower, cheaper memory. After writing these 4 gigabytes however, you will inevitably have data corruption. The original 4 GB stored on the card will start to be overwritten by the next data to come. This can result in a total loss of date. This is the big danger with fake cards. It's one thing to have a slow card, but another thing entirely to lose your data. You could lose valuable data and there are times when this data cannot be recovered.* Know that your storage space will always be less than advertised. In my case, my 128 GB card has an actual storage space of 119 GB. This is in mainly due to the fact that the advertised capacity is often the unformatted, ""RAW"" size in decimal (base 10) storage. However, your computer reads storage in binary (base 2) storage. In this case, if we take 128 GB of decimal gigabytes and convert it to binary gigabytes, we get 119.21 binary gigabytes. When your card is formatted, it is formatted using base 2 since your computer understands binary. Decimal is essentially only used for advertising as far as us typical consumers are concerned. H2testw will test the true capacity by filling the entire card with however much information it can put into it, then reading it back and verifying that the information stored is correct. A fake card may be 4GB and allow 119GB to be written to it, but when the information is checked, there will be discontinuities in the data and the fake card will be exposed as such.Good luck finding a card that works for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Good Card, Accurate Speeds",A.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2019",2 people found this helpful,"I ordered 2 x 128GB micro-SD cards and was hesitant after reading several reviews that people said they’d received knockoff/fake cards. One of the criteria they list is that the cards weren’t as fast as SanDisk indicates. Part of testing a card means you have to test it on a device capable or reading and writing at the speeds they list the cards are capable of. If your computer can only read and write at 30mb/s then that’s as fast as the cards will operate. I think people think that magically if they put a fast read/write card into a device that the cards should read/write at those speeds not taking into account what the specs are of the SD reader/writer. There are definitely videos online that will teach you what to look for to determine fakes with packaging, printing on the packaging and cards etc. I’m not saying fake cards aren’t on the market, but you’re more likely to get fake cards on eBay or some shady site. None of the 14 x SD and micro-SD cards I’ve purchased on Amazon have been fake and I’ve used them over periods of years with no issues. If you’re concerned about fakes then educate yourself on how to identify fake packaging and printing and if you get a card in and you identify that before you tear open the packaging then Amazon is always the easiest place ever to return them for a refund.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Educate yourself,Rand Ningali

"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"The special part of the SanDisk gold cards is the A2 rating. A2 means a minimum average of 4000 read operations or 2000 write operations per second. This is an ""or"", not ""and"". That means you could also have 3000 reads and 500 writes, or any similar proportion.For the average user, this means you could copy files to this SD card, and still change directories. You could run an application from the SD card, and it would load quickly. You could copy a lot of small files to the card, and it would keep copying rather than slow down to 30kb/sec.The V30 rating means that it should also have a sustained write speed of 30MB/sec. Burst, you'll get more, and new, you'll get more, but it's only guaranteeing an average sustained write speed of 30MB/sec.You can find V60 and V90, but you cannot find V90 and A2 on the same micro-SD card. Most V90 cards are full-sized SD, and most are functionally A1 or less.I picked this A2 card because of brand recognition - I've never had a SanDisk device fail on me, and they are owned by Western Digital now, which also has consistanly been one of the few reliable companies since the 1990s. I use this for my downloads folder. I keep a lot of data, and it's cheaper and more convenient to have this on a removable flash drive than on the internal NVMe. A2 means I can still unpack and run multi-gigabyte installers, unpack ISO files, etc without suffering the grind. I went with the half-TB because that was just starting to climb in dollars per GB.

I will address that issue. The maximum write speed is for short burst of time and a unreliable metric anyways. What photographers should note is the minimum write speed. Which both cards are rated at 30mb/s. The minimum write speed rates what the card will do consistently in a worst case (almost full, fragmented) 30mb/s is overkill in most situations today anyways. My Mavic 2 shooting 4K at H265 is writing data at 19mb/s. So either card does just fine. The card pictured in the left was purchased with my Mavic. The one on the right I purchased from amazon.

This is writing and reading 1.0 GB test files to the card.In Crystalmark, the Lexar combo achieved 94 MB/s sequential read and 83 MB/s sequential write, which Sandisk reader achieved 168 MB/s sequential read and 100 MB/s sequential write. If you look at the rest of the tests (random read/write), the Lexar combo is about 50% faster.Overall, for larger files, this reader is roughly 40% faster than using a microSD to SD adapter and regular SD card reader. To copy the contents of a 128GB card (that is advertised to work with it), that means cutting the time from 23 minutes to 13 minutes. However, it does not appear to perform well in other use cases (unverified).Another disadvantage: This USB reader does not fit in the same footprint as a SD card, so it does not store well in my memory wallet.

Some had black portions like half black and half my original picture. Some were gray with an exclamation mark in the middle. No matter how and where I viewed them, restarting my phone, checking settings, calling my phone manufacturer company, etc., I couldn't fix the problem. I was thinking virus, but the phone company helped me see if there was a virus on the phone which there wasn't. Also, somehow instead of pictures saving on my SD card from phone camera settings, they saved onto phone storage all by itself and the phone company couldn't figure out why. I used this for 7 months and had no problems, so I don't know how or why out of no where this happened. Also, the corrupted files were in one specific day's worth, but then it kept corrupting back to other days. Very unhappy about this. Next step would be to call SanDisk. I'll update after that.Jan. 14, 2019 review below:(Mostly same review as the other review I made of the Extreme Pro that I have because I bought both at the same time and they're basically the same thing.

I wanted to show what it looks like with it's package because I believe that is important to include which companies rarely ever show in their pictures. The package of the Sandisk microSD card version came with the adapter and the micro card as pictured and as described with functioning. I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S8+, and I'm sure it will work on any device that can take a micro sd card. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't malfunctioned by saving something from my phone onto the sd card, removing it from my phone, placing in adapter, inserting in my laptop sd card slot, and reading it from my computer, making sure what I saved was indeed there (and it was), reverse checked by putting something else from my computer in the sd card, removing from computer, inserting sd card in phone, and reading to make sure what I copied onto the card was there. So far so good.The first picture shows both of the items that I bought at the same time which came in the same package. As you can see, I already opened them. The second picture shows a close up of the product for this review facing up. The third shows a full picture of the entire package for this product.
