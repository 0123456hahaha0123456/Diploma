I installed this 8GB module in my new HP 14-an013nr notebook PC to replace the existing Samsung 4GB module. Performance was as expected until a sudden failure while in sleep mode overnight. The PC did not return from sleep. Hard reboot showed no POST -- no display at all. Replacing the Crucial memory module with the original Samsung module fixed the problem. Installed the Crucial module in an ACER AO756, producing the same result -- hard boot showed no POST or any indication of display activation or ROM initiation. Replacing the original 4GB module in the Acer corrected that failure also.I could not find that this memory has any warranty at all, so I'm disappointed. And out $60.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2016",84 people found this helpful,"OMG. Best purchase I've EVERRRRR MADE. I have the 2012 Macbook Pro (without Retina, obviously)- the 13 inch version. I did a lot of research before buying this one. If your mac is SLOW, TRY THIS!!!! I would recommend the 8gb if you aren't a gamer. I got accepted into a Bachelor's Degree program (Nursing) and my mac isn't even a year old- it was really angering me how it would constantly freeze up. I knew if I didn't do something fast, I would be ripping my hair out in class just to keep up with powerpoints and everything else. The computer at 4gb memory was enough to make my life a living hell. A lot of times I wouldn't even crack it open to use because I DREADED dealing with how slow it would get. I did multiple factory resets and erased everything, started from scratch. I even added CleanMyMac3 app which helped a wee-bit, but some things are just unavoidable. Still, every 5 minutes or so, my 4gb memory got maxed out. It was ANNOYING. So I took the plunge and ordered this Crucial 8GB kit and I have the BIGGEST regret: NOT ORDERING IT A LONG TIME AGO! It's a plug-n-play kind of thing for me. Literally all I did was unscrew the screws from my housing case and popped the case off the back of my mac and easily spotted the old RAM cards. I popped those out and added the new 8GB cards. There's youtube videos on how to upgrade your RAM in Mac. Easy stuff! Just make sure you wash your hands and you use a phillips head screw driver that fits the screws on the outer part of the case. You shouldn't have to unscrew anything inside the mac as far as I'm aware of- not in my Mac version anyway. I'm a lady and technology isn't even my thing. If I can do it, you can do. Oh, after you wash and dry your hands to remove skin oils, touch a real metal surface to discharge any static electricity before you do the work on your mac so you don't short anything out. Also make sure your mac is TURNED COMPLETELY OFF and the charger is removed from it! Good stuff. Can't go wrong with this one! My mac experience is crazy fast now. WOAH! Also would like to point out that my Mac is compatible with DDR3 Ram, but it accepted this DDR3L version like it didn't know any difference so you should be fine! :)",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,PERFECT FOR MacBook Pro 2012 13' NON-RETINA DDR3.,Ali & Zahra
"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2014",606 people found this helpful,"I purchased the Crucial CT2K8G3S160BM 2x8GB to increase the memory in my Lenovo Y410P laptop from 8-GB to 16-GB. My Y410P has two memory slots, and one slot was already occupied by a factory-installed Samsung M471B1G73QH0-YK0 8-GB memory card. I probably could have just added another 8-GB card. But to avoid any possible memory glitches, I prefer not to mix-and-match memory cards of different types. The existing Samsung memory was PC3L/DDR3L, with the 'L' signifying that it is low-voltage 1.35V memory, whereas the standard PC3/DDR3 memory uses a higher voltage of 1.50V. You should not combine memory of different voltages or use memory with incorrect voltage since your laptop may not even boot up. To further maximize compatibility with my laptop, since it came equipped with CL11 1600-MHz memory, I likewise wanted to stick with CL11 CAS Latency speed, instead of going for memory with a faster (lower) CL rating. Some CL9 memory cards have faster specifications, but I really think that most people will not notice 2-nanoseconds of extra latency. So I ordered this CL11 1600-MHz memory because I wanted to exactly match the specifications of my laptop's original 8-GB memory card to ensure compatibility since using mismatched memory can cause system instability. And this memory has been working flawlessly in my laptop!In real-world applications benchmarks, there is barely any difference between using CL11 memory and using some fancier CL9 memory, and the unnoticeable speed difference is not worth paying extra money for more-expensive models of CL9 or faster memory. With most applications, if you compare CL7, CL9, and CL11 application benchmarks, the differences mostly amount to 2% to 4% differences in benchmark timings. Along with the CL listing, another important memory performance indicator is bandwidth, and this Crucial memory's DDR3 1600MHz has a very good maximum bandwidth of 12800MB/s. But what does this mean in real-world performance terms? Relatively little. As long as you have enough memory to hold the applications that you are running without paging, RAM speed is only very rarely a performance bottleneck. Even with quad-core CPUs, the bottleneck is more likely still going to be the CPU . The reason for this is that the CPU's branch prediction algorithms are so accurate that, in the vast majority of circumstances, the data is already in the cache when the CPU needs it. So direct calls to RAM are quite rare. The branch predictor is like the CPU's personal assistant; it guesses what piece of information the boss needs next and makes sure it is already on his desk by the time he needs it. Occasionally, the assistant will get it wrong and the boss will have to forage around and find the information himself. In CPU terms, ""foraging around"" means retrieving the information from RAM, or (worst case scenario) disk, while if it is ""on the boss' desk"", that is equivalent to it being in the CPU's cache. And if your computer is equipped with an SSD using Intel's ""Smart Response Technology"" or if your computer uses SSDs instead of hard disks, it may retrieve the data from the speedy SSD instead of reading from a slower hard disk.So the days are long-gone when purchasing high-end expensive RAM actually makes a tangible difference to your computer's performance. As long as it meets the basic specifications that your chipset requires, there is not much to be gained by paying more. Some performance gains are possible from buying better RAM, but these days, most tests tend to show that such performance gains are minimal... far, far lower than you will get from adding more RAM (not necessarily faster RAM, just *more* RAM) or a faster CPU. This was not always the case. When the Pentium IV first came out thirteen years ago, it used a new type of RAM that had, at the time, very high bandwidth, but also very high latency. AMD's Athlon used traditional RAM with lower bandwidth and lower latency. Some types of applications (e.g. video and audio conversion) were very sensitive to bandwidth, but less sensitive to latency. These types of applications showed significant performance gains with the Pentium IV. Other applications (typically games and office applications) were more sensitive to latency and favored the Athlon.Overall, this Crucial memory is a great buy! Don't overspend on memory just because a brand or model of memory touts better specifications. If you are a hardcore computer gamer with a $4000 gaming laptop, you may opt for faster high-end memory to complement your top-of-the-line CPU and graphics. But most people should focus far more on how compatible that memory's specifications are for your system because the differences between CL ratings are negligible if you are considering CL rating differences of 2 or 3, while using memory that is not correctly matched or compatible with your computer can cause a variety of problems.After I removed the original Samsung 8-GB memory from my Y410P laptop and added these two Crucial SODIMM cards, I reran the Windows Experience Index benchmark and got the same WEI ""Memory operations per second"" score of 8.1 that I had with the Samsung memory. The WEI ""Processor: Calculations per second"" also remained unchanged at 8.1. This was not surprising considering that both the original Samsung memory and this Crucial memory have the same specifications.I also purchased a single 8GB card of this same Crucial memory to upgrade my HP Chromebox, which comes equipped with only 2GB in its single memory slot. There is a lot of misleading information on the Internet stating the maximum memory that you can use in the HP Chromebox is 4GB. But that is incorrect since the HP Chromebox can fully use 8GB of memory. After I upgraded my HP Chromebox, the Memory Monitor app on its Chrome OS displayed the memory capacity as 7.9GB. 2GB of memory is sufficient for a Chromebook/Chromebox if you are just browsing with a few tabs open. But if you want to open up lots of tabs and run lots of apps, or if you plan to install Linux or Windows on your Chromebook/Chromebox, then adding more memory will help with performance.Note that Crucial has two identical 16-GB 2x8GB kits with identical specifications, with each memory product having two different part numbers: CT2K8G3S160BM/CT2C8G3S160BM ",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great upgrade for Lenovo Y410P, HP Chromebox.

Both of these products are dual-voltage and can work in either 1.35V PC3L/DDR3L or 1.50V PC3/DDR3 memory slots.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2018",9 people found this helpful,"Bought this for my office Dell Inspiron One 2330. It's been hobbled by having only 4GB of ram (and further hobbled by supporting only 8 in total). it arrived in 2 days and was a snap to install. Essentially you remove the panel behind the stand, unscrew the 4 screws holding the stand on the back, then 4 smaller philips screws on the bottom of the display frame and pop out the frame. A small - cheap - cover over the memory slot bay pops off and you insert the new memory.The BIOS auto-recognizes the memory but if you want to be sure, at boot just press [F2] when you see the Dell logo and go into the BIOS and look. F10 to exit and boot to your OS. That's it.I'm actually running Photoshop CC, CorelDraw and other apps on this machine (but not a heavy user so can't justify a ""real"" computer), and although they take forever to load, the additional ram is certainly noticeable. If you're just running multiple apps like I do most of the day you'll see a difference too. I run a dual screen setup with Thunderbird, Chrome, Firefox, Excel, Word, and Pandora streaming all the time. Then Access about a third the time on top of this as well as some small stuff like ""stickies"" and other utilities. Overall the system is much smoother with less latency.I'm old as dirt and remember the first time I had to add 4 MEGS of ram to my 486DLC. It cost $320. So now I got 1000 times as much memory for 11% the cost. Amazing. (actually I remember my first 8088 PC with an amber monitor and twin 5.25"" floppies. No hard drive.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"My wife's Macbook Pro is getting pretty old now, and she's been complaining that it's ""slow"". So went through the startup processes and installed apps and removed everything she isn't using, then bought this memory upgrade.Generally speaking, Ram is either good or not. In my I.T. career I have heard of ""bad ram"" that causes reboots, corruption, etc, but this rarely the case where someone would notice it (more often a system just becomes ""unstable"" and needs to be rebooted more often or locks up/reboots once in a while). If someone is really paranoid they can use ram with Error Correction for a server (used for critical applications where errors are catastrophic), and/or test the ram to make sure it doesn't have any diagnostic errors. But in general, ram is ram and if it works it works. There's no moving parts so if you encounter issues it's far more likely to be the wrong product or poor installation than a bad piece of hardware unless you are buying from a vendor that does not test their product before shipment or knowingly is selling you bad product. That said...Installation is dead simple for my wife's old Macbook. Remove screws. Push in tabs to pop out old ram. Install new ram by pushing pins into slot firmly and pushing down to swing arm into place and lock ram. Turn on to make sure no ram error on boot and all ram recognized. Turn off and screw back panel back on. Done!All ram recognized, no errors (so far) and large applications load faster. I think my wife will really (not) notice the difference with large applications and files. In other words if she's running several apps at once and/or working with images she WON'T notice chugging and slowdown.So yes, if you have an old machine that doesn't come with 8gb of ram already, this is a good upgrade. I don't recommend upgrading to more ram than that for most people since they won't notice the difference once there's enough for all OS files to load into ram and apps to load into ram without disk swapping (paging). Beyond that you will generally know if you need more ram because you'll be a professional working with ram images, 3D editing, video editing, or something else that requires more ram to function.Interestingly most games will never require a high amount of ram unless you are running at very high resolutions (4K, etc) so leave the bigger ram upgrades to the professionals and install this upgrade to 8gb for everyday use. 4gb is too low to run a modern operation system smoothly without slowdown.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A Crucial Upgrade For an Old Macbook,Strategos

This will help me make the proper router configurations for the replication processes.

Sometimes my reviews can be a little wordy, but I do it mainly to help novice to intermediate users. This particular review, became more of an Alienware review than it is about the memory. I any case, if you are an Alienware owner, you should know this memory will work for you.The improvements I've noticed by upgrading from 4GB (DDR3-1333) are small at this point, but significant since I'm no longer having crashes from insufficient RAM particularly when I switch between log-ins. I'm running a lot of peripherals and multiple Operating Systems; Windows 7 Pro SP1 64bit, Red Hat Fedora 20, and with MS Virtual PC 2007, I'm using XP Media Center Edition 2005 SP3 32bit, Vista for Business SP3 32bit, and 7 Home Premium SP1 64bit. I know this system is compatible, but I haven't installed Windows Pro 8.1 64bit yet and I'm still not sure if I want to. I use this system for both gaming and as reference with desktop support calls, which is why I use two versions of Windows 7 and probably should add 8.1.The boot time has improved moderately for each of my operating systems, in some cases only by a few seconds which I attribute to my multi-boot configuration. Load times for some software under Windows has also improved, as with Adobe Photoshop CS5, and The Sims 3. Virus and malware scanning time has been cut down by nearly half the time. Since this system memory bus can only support 10666MHz, I am not seeing any changes in benchmarks due to the 12800MHz capable RAM upgrade, nor did I expect to. The memory is perfectly stable at the slower rate. Windows Index Rating also remains the same, and because Linux has low overhead system requirements - it's still just plain fast.I would have bought the 16GB kit, but I was getting conflicting, false, or misleading information about the maximum limits from my owner's manual and Dell technical support. The manual says 8GB and I have 3 different answers from Dell's staff who stated a) ...your system was delivered with the components it was designed to support... it took several tries for me to understand the accent before I realized he was implying it cannot be upgraded at all, b) The system will support up to 16GB, providing you have updated the BIOS to version A12, however, that was erroneous because the last firmware release is A10, and c) Windows only supports up to 4GB of RAM... which is argumentatively true under a 32bit environment and XP, but I'm mainly running W7 64bit so the response was irrelevant. Other sources claim it WILL support 8GB and may or may not support up to 16GB. I was not willing to risk the expense and hassle of finding out first hand and went with 8GB based on my manual and the fact that it was the largest kit offered on the Dell website for the M17x-R2.I've used Crucial Memory in several computers over the past years and have always had excellent results. The reliability has been unsurpassed by other makers.

Crucial memory is very reliable and reasonably priced. In my experience it's extremely rare for RAM to go bad after the initial install, though it's certainly possible.To install the RAM just shutdown, unplug power/remove battery, remove the old RAM, put in the new RAM and put battery back in/plug in power and boot it up. You can check whether the RAM was recognized in your BIOS (generally hitting the Delete key at boot-up, sometimes F2) or in Windows.In Windows you can check this in several places depending on your OS version, but the easiest place that works on all Windows OS versions is by holding down your Windows key and pressing R (the one with the Windows logo between CTRL and ALT). This brings up the Run window. In there, type ""dxdiag"" (no quotes though) and hit OK/run. You will get a diagnostics window that will display your system information with your Memory info.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2015",One person found this helpful,"First I'd like to say is, this RAM is very affordable and worth it. Unlike, the name brand that cost $10 more per stick which works just as well. Crucial is a reputable company in my opinion. I own ram and an ssd from this company and still no complaints. I originally had 4 gbs of 1333 mhz ram, and it wasn't cutting it for me. I do somewhat heavy application use and multitasking. I'd find my laptop running slightly slow when I had multiple programs open. Every time I check task manager, ram usage was around 70-95% under load, which was annoying since I had barely anything open and pc was running slow. No other hardware in the system was causing this, as I have a higher end i5 with a GTX 660m. Have no idea why the manufacturer decided to only include 4 gb in this system. However, now my productivity has improved by about 40%, and my ram usage hovers around 60%. I'm happy that's all I can say. Overall, this ram is going to give you the most bang for your buck, It's not absolutely cheapo ram, like that generic ones (which probably works just as well, but reliability not so much) . Yet, it's not ""top of the line"" name brand that's going to cost you that much more, when you could be investing into something else more effective.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This ram will give you more bang for your buck.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2015",2 people found this helpful,"This review is going to be specific to my computing situation, and contain information that I wished were already in the reviews prior to my purchase (mostly because I was very nervous as to whether this was the right ram for me, and I assume there might be others out there who are nervous about purchasing this ram for their identical systems).I have two identical laptops, which are Samsung R780 models. I have the US versions, and they’re commonly referenced on websites as the R780 Red models. They run the Intel Core i5-430M processors on motherboards which run the Intel HM55 chipset. The stock memory were 2x2GB (for a total of 4GB) Samsung PC3-8500 (1066MHz) DDR3 modules which are dual voltage modules capable of running at either 1.35v or 1.5v—however on my laptops the stock memory ran at the higher voltage of 1.5v. The stock ram modules had a latency rating of 7-7-7-20.Prior to purchasing this kit I had some concerns about whether it would work in my system. The item description here on Amazon mentions it is dual voltage (just like my stock ram was) however the official Crucial website states only the 1.35 voltage. Further, the sticker on the ram, as well as the sticker on the retail packaging, only mention the 1.35 voltage (mentioned in other reviews, but I can confirm that is how it is on the product). I contacted Crucial’s customer service and they did verify that the ram is dual voltage capable, so I went ahead and purchased it, and what follows are my results.This ram was plug-and-play without requiring any adjustments to my bios settings. It “under clocked” automatically down to the PC3-8500 (1066MHz) that my system is capable of utilizing. In doing so, it runs at a latency of 8-8-8-19 and at a voltage of 1.35v. This was rather surprising to me as my stock ram ran at the higher 1.5v and though this ram is capable of achieving the higher voltage, my laptops are happy to run it at the lower voltage. Another surprising result was that although the CL rating is slightly higher than the stock ram, this ram actually outperforms the stock ram within Windows 7. The WEI rated the stock ram at a 5.9, whereas this replacement ram rates as a 6.6 on one laptop and a 6.7 on the other laptop. I've now doubled my previous amount of ram, and have maxed out the laptop's capabilities (as it can only accommodate 8GB of ram).If you’re like me, and have a Samsung R780 that you feel is plenty powerful to do the things you want to do, but that needs a little more ram for multitasking (or just having 20 tabs open in your web browser) then I can recommend this ram and can confirm that it will run on this system. It will run at a lower voltage and still outperform the stock ram. I’ve only had the ram for about a week, but the difference is noticeable for me (especially when having a lot of internet tabs open) as the computer can store more in the ram and not have to access the much slower on-hard-drive page file to store and retrieve data. Hopefully the longevity of the product is as good as I’ve experienced with previous Crucial purchases, but I will update this review in the future if I encounter any issues.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Works great in Samsung R780 laptops,V.

All references agree that the voltage should be 1.5V. The memory Lenovo originally installed was stamped 1.5V.I ordered the memory assuming the maintenance manual was out of date, the firmware release notes were correct, and the memory supported 1.35V as well as 1.5V.The memory arrived and the Crucial packaging stated 1.35V only. Their web site only shows 1.35V in the specifications. The Crucial web site has a spot to enter your PC information and it will tell you if the memory is compatible with the PC. The web site says the memory is compatible with a 6136-B22. I decided Crucial's warranty would trump all the conflicting information I found.I threw caution to the wind and installed it. I ran memtest86 on it for 15 minutes and no failure appeared. (And yes... 24 hours would be a better test.) I've been using this Win7 PC for quite a few days now.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2015",2 people found this helpful,"(EDIT July 17th, 2016): This memory kit seems to have developed a rather nasty error in the second DIMM around the 11GB mark, so I've removed the offending stick and am running on 8gb only for now. I knocked a star off for a less than 1yr lifespan, but this is honestly the first problem I've had with Crucial memory so far. I haven't decided as of yet whether I'm going to buy another Crucial kit or try a different manufacturer, but I would still consider buying from them.------------Original Review:Crucial is the only brand of memory I trust. I've used them extensively in multiple computer repair projects, and they've had yet to fail me. They've delivered again with this great memory kit, perfect for higher end laptops that are struggling with a low memory limit.I've got an Inspiron 7720, which originally came with 8gb of RAM. That was fine for quite some time, but as I've recently gotten into heavy rendering and video editing, that 8gb was filling up fast. Dell doesn't recommend using more than 8gb, but I was able to install this 16gb kit and use it without a hitch. Attached to this comment are pictures of the memtest86+ results (Which showed no errors, great QA!), SPD information, and a CPU-z validation confirming the presence of a full 16gb of true Crucial memory (and not some mislabeled Chineze junk, you have to watch out for those!)Once I got back to Windows, the effect on Adobe Premiere was like night and day. On only 8gb of RAM, it would constantly thrash the disk when playing back 1080p clips in the arranger, and would slow to a crawl on longer, more complex timelines. With 16GB, it was able to cache most of the timeline previews into memory, avoiding the constant disk I/O and the resulting slowdown. Blender also saw some improvement, adding a small increase to render speed and making it much more fluid when creating objects.The RAM also came in a great package. It always irks me when companies send a massive box for a tiny item, regardless of how fragile (or how strong) the item may be. This kit came in a simple bubblewrap envelope, with the RAM modules themselves inside a tough plastic tray. The package opened with a minimum amount of fuss, although it was a bit tricky to get the RAM out of the tray without bending it! I'm even reusing that tray for my old RAM, which I'll most likely resell in the near future.I would highly recommend any Crucial products, whether they're RAM modules or SSD's, to anybody looking for new memory or an upgrade.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2016",3 people found this helpful,"My old laptop has two RAM slots for So-DIMM, but only one was being used and it only had a 4GB stick. It also has 2 x 4GB of onboard RAM. With only 12 GB total, it had issues running some of the newer games and other programs (ESRI ArcGIS & AutoCAD). So, time for an upgrade! I bought this two-pack of 2 x 8GB to effectively double my RAM to 24 GB. The price for the 2-pack is very nice compared to individual stick prices! It was delivered in just about a week and a half, too! It's only been in my computer for a week, but it seems to be working perfectly and that is the main thing that had me worried when I bought it; I'd heard rumors of people getting ""dead stick"" memory chips sometimes, but mine work fine.This is DDR3L 1600 speed RAM designed for a SO-DIMM plug. It is for LAPTOPS, only a very few and very rare desktops will use this type of RAM stick!! So if you are shopping for a desktop upgrade, make sure you really have a DDR3 SO-DIMM plug in there! As for the speed factor, realistically you can use ANY speed RAM stick in any slot as long as the DDR version matches. If your computer's port is listed for 1200 speed and you use 1600 speed sticks then you will not get full 1600 performance but you will still be able to run it at 1200 speed since that is the limiting factor on your system. Or, if your computer can handle 1600 speed and you buy 1200 sticks, you will only run at 1200 then too because it is the max speed for that stick. So the speed doesn't necessarily have to match up. But the DDR type does. Make sure you really want DDR-3 with a SO-DIMM style plug!!
