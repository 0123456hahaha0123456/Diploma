The button location are solid enough for me to be satisfied the only issue I have with this mouse is that the scroll wheel now spins freely and is one hell of a headache playing most fps games as the wheel usually switches weapons in most games.So for example you run out of ammo in game and want to switch to your secondary.. well you'll switch to it but switch right back about 3 times. Kind of a deal breaker for clutch moment gaming.***edit***Turns out i'm an idiot. There's a button that locks and unlocks the scroll wheel..LMAO sooo yeah no this mouse is great i'm just not smart enough to properly utilize it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great mouse, except the one flaw",RotCorp
"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2019",221 people found this helpful,"This would be a wonderful mouse other than the constant click/double click issue. The first one I had for a very short time. During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly. Amazon was great and provided an exchange. During the time I had the new one, I was not doing as much gaming/designing so the click issue took longer to show up. I am convinced this is a design flaw in the mouse itself. I will not purchase another one of these. The price is not worth it at all with the click issue. To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks. I have tested this extensively. If it wasn't for that issue, this mouse would be wonderful. However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Click/Double Click Issues All the Time...,Kandice
"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2018",223 people found this helpful,"Let me start by saying that I've used a lot of gaming mice, like, over 50 of them. The Logitech g502 was always a quality mouse and tons of people love the thing just based on the design and overall quality of the mouse; That being said, there are a few things to consider if you're thinking about getting this one in particular.The Pros of this mouse are fairly straightforward, and are as follows:- Comfortable shape for most right handed people, but should be more comfortable for people with medium to large size hands.- Good build quality which easily places it in the same category as other 'premium' around this price point or even a bit higher.- Scroll wheel: this is one of my personal favorite features of the mouse. Allows infinite scroll to get through annoying EULA pages quicker and also quickly raise or lower volume on YouTube or other video streaming sites, but without sacrificing the much needed precision of the standard mouse wheel steps. Feels satisfying to use, but it is made of metal, which leads to a negative I'll be mentioning later on.- Sensor: The Logitech Hero sensor has been tested numerous times and found to be roughly on par with the PMW3360 series sensors (including the 3366 on the original g502) while being advantageous for usage in wireless mice due to the lessened draw of power which allows for a longer battery life.The Cons of this mouse make it hard to recommend to everyone, and are why I don't usually recommend it as a first choice.-Weight: My god. This thing is one of the heaviest mice I've used for an extended period of time. I don't know exactly how much this weighs, but it feels pretty similar to the original, which I believe weighed in a little over 130 grams. Most gaming mice target a weight of 100g or LIGHTER, since lowering the weight of the mouse will make extended use easier and will allow for a greater degree of control.- Not a truly ""safe"" shape, this may or may not matter to you, but I felt that it's worth mentioning. Obviously this is a mouse for right handed people, and it may not necessarily be a great fit for you if your hands are very small (I have very small hands and cannot reach the sniper button at all, but the mouse is still comfortable).I would say it's a top tier mouse, but only if you can look past the weight. I would recommend that, as always, if you have the ability to do so, you should go to a local store and try some of the mice out to see which feels best to you, and make your decision after you have an idea what type of mouse shape you want.I won't recommend that you do or don't buy a product, so I'll leave it at that.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Overall not significantly different from the original, but adds support for the updated software.",Shi Hao

"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2020",49 people found this helpful,"It seems logitech has either a quality control problem or a supply problem because the switches in these mice are absolute garbage. The mouse is honestly one of the best mice I have ever used while it worked - until it didn't. Less than a year old and $75 gets you a mouse that feels great in the hand until the scroll wheel starts jumping around and the left click starts randomly double clicking, and then not clicking at all - all intermittently. There are numerous reviews out there one can find by simply googling ""g502 double click"" in which people either return them and hope their next one doesn't do the same, refund them, or the more technical self swap of a mechanical switch for the left click.I will not be going any of these routes and I'm sad to say it because Logitech used to be a staple in PC peripherals. Now it's not the plastic it's made of.edit: As I write this update, I have actually taken another star off for the true, 1 star review. I typically don't believe in one star reviews because it's generally an overreaction and everything is either 5 stars great or 1 star horrible, but Logitech has sunken to the 1 star territory. After literally 15 emails back and forth with Logitech support, I had to use their website to prove I was having a double click issue, which was easily done, but had to film both myself, the mouse, and the serial number from the mouse in the video while doing it. I could easily reproduce the double click fault in both the left AND right click function and sent proof. I sent my mouse back to Logitech on approx the 10th of January 2020. They received my mouse the 15th of January 2020. I don't hear anything for 8 days until I first contact them again asking for an update. Still nothing. Finally I receive an email stating that my product is not faulty, and therefore doesn't qualify for the warranty. Nevermind the evidence I had to first email them. Nevermind the 100% reproduce able error in both left and right clicking.I will never buy a logitech product again.Do yourself a favor and google 'logitech double click' and question whether you want to buy this mouse, likely have the issue, and then not have the warranty honored. I bought a cheap mouse replacement to tide me over and it works much better anyway.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Worth it, if you're lucky",Optimus-SubPrime
"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2018",66 people found this helpful,"This review is for the Hero version of G502. I have stopped using Logitech mice since they discontinued G9. I have been using Roccat Kone XTD since then that died after serving me for over 5 years. After reading reviews about G502 I decided to give it a try as I really liked the overall design and feel , it reminded me of G9.So when I learned they are refreshing the 502 with a new sensor I was skeptical to pay $30 more for the new one. Now that I used it I am glad I did. The refreshed model has a really thick and flexible cord that was apparently a major weakness in the original 502. Couple that with a really awesome sensor that is super accurate and sensitive to slightest movements and tracks on any surface (seriously I tried everything from a white paper to the palm of my hand) and you have a potential winner. However, the best part of this mouse is not that or the the materials that they used which also feels really nice and durable.While subjective and relevant to how big or small your hands are for me the way the mouse sits in my hand and how easy it is to access the buttons are the best indicators . The buttons themselves feel very satisfying to press thanks to the spring loaded mechanism. Last but not least is the scroll wheel. This... this scrollwheel I can probably write a whole paragraph on how good it is... Not only does it have the infinite mode that rolls beautifully but also its made from METAL. Its a nice chunk of metal that is just better than a plastic one in every way. I dont think I can go back to plastic mouse-wheels after using my G502. You might never use the 16000DPI sensor but if you used G502 and similar mice in the past and are due for an upgrade the refresh 502 is totally worth the money Logitech is asking for.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Really well made mouse.

Improved braided cable over previous G502 model.2.) The weight options are exact same as previous model. (Feels identical in all ways, easy to get used to.)3.) I'm about 6'-6"" and little over 200 lbs - fits my hand fairly well. (They don't make many BIG HAND mice :)4.) DPI shift button is epic for sniping btw!!! (Great for nudging objects in Adobe too.)5.) LIGHTSYNC added to this model is cool for custom rigs & lighting. (Single click, easy to enable.)6.) Fully customizable RGB LED, you can set color, cycle speed & mode indicators.7.) VERY VERY accurate mouse, 4,000 DPI higher than previous 12,000 DPI 502 model. 16,000 DPI is insane resolution tbh.8.) Rubberized areas can handle greasy, salty gamer hands lol (see pics.)....they are the most durable grips I have ever seen in my 30 years of using mice.:: CONS ::((FAILED)) LEFT MOUSE BUTTON FAILURE - The older version I have is more reliable after 3 years. Logitech products across the board are having durability issues. Their OLDER 2015 - 2018 Products were far superior. Not sure what is going on with their design and quality control, but after MANY years and thousands of dollars of products there is a noticeable DROP in QUALITY & more specifically DURABILITY. ((Possibly they are too trick for their own good)1.) The cord is much better, but this mouse still has one. (It's hard to find CONS with the G502 HERO.)2.) Really miss the cordless days, but this mouse catches every signal & the slightest movements.3.) The RGB is usually not prominent as it's under your hand or in sleep mode.4.) Free wheel mouse mode can be sensitive to twitch gaming. Some rolling can occur, but you gotta be really shaking it.:: OVERALL :: I HATE CORDS, but I love this mouse so I am always torn between both worlds. I need to be highly accurate in my video, photography & gaming life, all the G502 series mice have enhanced my computer work & play!I have purchased 3 of them now, 2 of which have HEAVY use & abuse....they still work perfectly and remain accurate. Seriously this mouse brought my K/D up to new highs, it's so much better than the $100 cordless laser I'm still kind of in shock. It's a gaming AND business must have. Using this for websites, photo editing & detail alignments in Adobe is a dream come true.DON'T FORGET IT's EVEN GOT MACROS!?!? I don't use them to their full potential, but the few macros I have are awesome!FINAL NOTE: My first G502 is still rock solid even after years of abuse, nothing has failed. Mouse wheel is 100% & so is the weight latch.I hated Logitech until I used the 502's, their mousewheels fail, wireless signal loss is constant (with exception to the $100 wireless lasers.) AND the rubberized grips always turned to 'sticky goo' after 3-4 years. I was pissed off at Logitech when I bought the 502 & was ready to rip apart this mouse in a review if it SUCKED.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"((UPDATE)) FAILED @ 14 MONTHS, I OWN THREE G502's SO FAR...",HAPPY TIMES
"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2019",44 people found this helpful,"I really wanted to love this mouse. This style of form factor, with a nice little ledge for your thumb to rest on, doesn't get enough love from mouse OEMs. I also am a contrarian in still liking heavier mice, despite the recent trend in favor of ultra-light mice, and this thing feels nice and solid with the weights added. Finally, I really liked that the mouse is WIRED. Having run the gamut of wireless mice, I have found no matter what the claims are, they always are prone to connection glitches and, even when they work well for a time, are a PITA to always remember to keep charged. The new hero sensor is also awesome.Because of these desirable properties I lived in a state of denial about the mouse's many glaring flaws for months.Sadly, I am out of denial and into grief.The main issue with this mouse is the scroll wheel. It just sucks. The mouse semi-regularly just decides the scroll wheel is being clicked, resulting in lots of odd behavior. And then it's hard to know when you've successfully clicked the scroll wheel down, because it requires so much actuation force and yet has so little travel.The free-wheeling mode of the scroll wheel is reasonably nice, with a satisfying long spin, but it's almost impossible not to occasionally click the button that puts it back into incremental scrolling mode. This is a big deal, because the incremental scrolling mode is unbelievably ghastly and thus something you would never use voluntarily The tactility feels all wrong--both too abrupt/tactile and not sticky enough for something that is so abrupt/tactile. At the same time, the scroll wheel actually rattles because of the force of the increments--but only like maybe half the time. The combination of these features induces an overall sensation of unpredictability and randomness along with an unpleasant sound.A less critical but still painful flaw is the button placement. The idea of a little ledge sticking out is to use a palm grip and rest your thumb there, right? One would think so. However, doing so places one of the other two main side buttons totally out of reach. You have bend your thumb back so hard to reach back button that it basically means only a claw grip is truly comfortable--in which case the thumb ledge goes unused.So, all in all, yeah I think Logitech should go back to the drawing board and generate this style of mouse with different button placement and a much more nicely tuned scroll wheel.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Whack,block_header

I did not want to spend another $99 on that and hopped this mouse would work better.The good:- It is a nice looking mouse from outsideThe bad:- Right out of the box, this mouse started randomly double clicking or needed to click multiple times for it to react.- On free-wheel mode, it just scrolls with the movement of the mouse, even if the wheel is not moving at all.- Not at all ergonomic, it will hurt your hand after 10 minutes using it. The back is too narrow, no support for the right side of your hand, and to hold it properly you have to close your hand in an awkward way.- Both options of the software to program/change settings are unnecessarily intrusive on your computer, and every 30 minutes or so, make it go sluggish with the mouse barely responding. If you remove the software the default settings for the buttons are useless.I have been a loyal Logitech buyer for over 20 years, but the quality of their products has been on a free fall for a while now, and this is the last product I buy from them.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2019",25 people found this helpful,"Purchased this mouse on July 2nd and as of the day of this review the mouse went from being a 5 to a 1. I really expected so much more out of Logitech and incredibly upset that in less then a month the mouse is already giving me issues. I purchased this mouse to replace my old razer deathadder which lasted me for approximately 3 years. I figured since I already owned the G402 that it would make sense to upgrade to a G502 and give it a shot with the weights feature. The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about. So when I play Overwatch I play A LOT of widow and recently the right click would always double click as I'm sitting there scoped in. It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly. So if you're looking for a game that you need to scope STAY AWAY. The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews. So again, if you need to hold your clicks, keep searching for another mouse. Shame on you Logitech :(",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Right click doesn't hold. Keeps double clicking,Luis C.
"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2020",14 people found this helpful,"Loved this mouse for 3 months, absolutely everything. Then one day it started to randomly double click on the right mouse button, but only maybe once per 1,000 clicks, no big deal right? Wrong. This escalates and quickly becomes to 1 in every 10 clicks just a month after you notice the first double click issue starting. Being a ""gaming mouse"", and a reputable company, I expected more. I took the time to write the review now because after 4 months with my right click double clicking every 1 out of 10 clicks the left mouse button has started the 1 out of 1,000. My fear is that in another month I'll have the same issue with the left click.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020",9 people found this helpful,"This was a really great mouse prior to it developing a double left click issue under a year of use. I did some digging online and found that this seems to be due to their mouse switches.I've been a big Logitech fan since the G15 and G9 days. I'm currently still using a G13 and G910 but I will be avoiding Logitech mice going forward. I'm currently thinking about going back to Razer mice due to this cheaping out on the switches issue to save a few dollars.Logitech, if you are reading this: if you need to charge an extra 5 dollars to put great switches in your mice, then DO IT! Making cheap products like this only hurts your brand and will make people move away from you. I went from Razer mice to Logitech because their mice had a fraying issue with their cords and Logitech was one of the first to start making them with a reinforced wire to prevent it! Looks like I'm going back to Razer as the tables have turned now. Fix your products Logitech!I'm just glad I still have my older G502 Proteus Core and Proteus Spectrum mice to fall back on for the time being as those had switches that don't seem to have the issue.RMA is not worth it to me as I've read the review people have had them go bad again due to their bad switches.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2019",13 people found this helpful,"I've always loved Logitech products, and have used them for decades because of their quality and customer service.But this mouse, even when it's working, is just above average for a gaming mouse IMO. It has high DPI settings which is nice, but mostly useless because not many people even get close to touching those settings. They're far too sensitive for the vast majority of people.The main problem with this mouse is quality. It'll last you between 6 months and a year before the left click stops working properly. There have been issues with left click problems for YEARS on Logitech mice, and it doesn't seem like they've done anything to try to fix the problem.I have 4 versions of this mouse in my house. My girlfriend has the previous non-Hero version, and that worked great for about 2 solid years of very light use before it started having issues. When you click, it double clicks. It's very frustrating and annoying.I built my daughter a computer a year ago, and got her the Hero. It worked great at first, so I decided to get me one too. Mine lasted until the RMA period was over, and then the left click stopped working. Not the typical double click problem though. Mine can't register a click+hold for long. So when you try to drag an icon on your desktop to the trash, it'll just keep dropping the icon in random places. If you try to bookmark a tab in your browser? Drag it half way and it'll suddenly let go of the tab and create a new browser window out of the tab. Try to drag mail to a folder in Outlook? It'll probably let go of the mail and drop it in the wrong folder, etc... If you have to click+hold in a game to register an action? It won't work.At this point, my daughters mouse was still working, so I thought maybe I just got a defective mouse. I went to Fry's (instead of buying on Amazon this time, because I was in a hurry) and bought the exact same mouse. It hasn't even been 6 months and it already has the same exact problem.All 4 of our Logitech mice, similar make and model, have all had problems with the left click. All of them purchased from different places over 2+ years of time. The problems I'm having aren't just a fluke. They're not a result of getting a unlucky bad mouse. There's a very good chance if you buy this mouse, you'll have similar problems within a year, even with light use. As a gaming mouse, this thing should be able to stand up to abuse, but it'll break even with light use. That makes it a BAD gaming mouse, and a bad mouse in general. Even writing this review, I tried to highlight some text to copy/paste it to another section, and I can't even do that. I had to hold shift+arrow keys to highlight the text because my mouse will just delete it or move it to some random places while I'm still holding left click/dragging. Ugh.On top of that, this mouse is fairly skinny and does not fit large hands very well. It's not comfortable at all unless you have fairly small hands. The Corsiars M65 was a much better fit for large hands, and is just as good as the G502 in pretty much every way except looks, and far better in terms of quality/longevity.As an old school Logitech fanboy, it makes me really sad to write this review.Don't buy this mouse.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021",6 people found this helpful,"I was a big fan of Logitech, all the mice that I have purchased for all my computers since the 1990's have been either Logitech (95%) or Razer (5%) and ive had over 20 mice over the years. I dont mistreat my mice, the reason that I usually end up replacing mice is because a newer one comes out with more buttons or features and I replace my current mouse. Unfortunately on the Logitech G502 Hero the left mouse button starts to malfunction and to click an extra time or wont hold the left mouse button down when I have my finger held down on it (to drag objects on the screen) it will release the button without me letting go of the button effectively making it impossible to drag objects across the screen. The left mouse button will also start experiencing issues where it starts to click more than the times that you actually clicked, 1 click will register as 2-3 clicks and double clicking will register as if you clicked 4+ times.The Logitech G502 Hero that I purchased from Amazon for $68.29 on 04/18/2019 started experiencing the dreaded extra clicking and unable to hold the left mouse button down issues on 03/30/2020 (a little less than a year after purchase) and I contacted Logitech support which then had me follow several troubleshooting steps and film a video of the issue with my phone's camera and send it to them. Logitech replaced the original defective mouse for free on 04/05/2020 but now on 01/15/2021 the replacement mouse that Logitech sent me is starting to experience the same issue agian with the left mouse button clicking extra times and releasing the left mouse button when I have my finger held down without me letting go of the button, thats the second G502 Hero thats failed in under a year.Almost all the 20+ mice that I have purchased since the 1990's have been Logitech (95%) which were excellent quality and the other 5% have been Razer mice which were not as good as the Logitech mice and were overpriced. I dont really think its worth it to spend $50+ on a mouse and then have it fail at 12 months or less so this time I purchased a $20 Asus TUF M3 to replace my $68.29 Logitech G502 Hero, at least if the Asus mouse starts having the same issue at a year or less I only spent $20 on it. I hope that Logitech quality improves in the future because I was reading 3 star and under reviews online for the Logitech G502 Hero and the issues that I am experiencing seem to be pretty common (it seems that the sensor that registers the clicks is made in China and is poor quality) some people mention that they replaced the sensor that registers mouse clicks with a Japanese sensor and it got rid of the issues but im not technical enough to open up the mouse, find the replacement part online, and then put it in the defective mouse so ill just buy a replacement $20 mouse from Asus.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Started extra clicking after 11 months, Logitech replaced it for free and...",Jason Smith

Both take me directly back to the product page creating an endless cycle. I also tried the ""Support Bot"" and go to the point where it asked if I wanted to create a ticket, but it just shows a repeated progress meter like it is going to do something and never actually completes.While not directly related to this issue, I also had a Logitech K810 keyboard fail, which was BEFORE COVID and the device was quickly replaced (when I could actually reach someone); however, it was within a 3 month period of having purchased that product as well.I have used Logitech products since the 1980s, but given this many failures in such short periods of time I cannot and will not recommend using their products any longer.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Two G502 Heros - Two broken left button sensors within a few months each,GRM
"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020",6 people found this helpful,"I ignored the reviews that reported the double-click issue. There's been times I've bought products others said were defective and never had a problem, so I figured I would still get it. That was just gambling for quality, trying to beat the odds. Boy, is my face red. Bought at the end of April, double-clicking severely by October. Trying to do anything with this mouse is now a hassle. Most games are unplayable. If I click once, I need it to register one click. Not two, three, or more. I contacted Logitech support, as it is under warranty. After about a week they responded with a process that almost completely would absolve them of having to follow through - jumping through hoops with steps up to and including a click testing website where you have to record video with your phone and send it to them to prove it. I'm not going to deal with such an absurd process, so while they may have saved on having to honor the warranty, they've lost a customer. I'll never buy a Logitech product again. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Don't buy this. You will get the same issue, almost guaranteed.Aside from the issue above, the mouse has programmable DPI settings. Which is nice, and only necessary because the default settings are weirdly too fast or too slow. The buttons to change the DPI settings is in a spot where I constantly hit them accidentally, which is annoying, but I think that's more a me problem. The RGB lights change colors, but the mouse doesn't remember that until the Logitech software you need to have is turned on. The mouse wheel either spins freely, which is stupid, or turns into a chunky megalithic clickmonster if you lock it. The scroll left/right by moving the mouse wheel left or right doesn't really work correctly. Neither does pressing in the mouse wheel to scroll up or down by holding it. It just stops. Very frustrating.Decent heavy duty cord, ergonomically ok, comfortable at least. You can change the little weights inside but I'll be honest, unless you're some kind of die-hard gamer playing semi-professionally I can't see any reason someone would need that. Ultimately, I give the whole thing two stars; it probably would have been four but it loses one for the multi click problem almost everyone seems to get, and another for the unbelievable burden their support places on people to discourage anyone from actually being able to get a fix or replacement under warranty.

If you think it's cool, have fun.- Still ergonomic as ever. I use mine with an old IMAK ergoBeads wrist pad and no pain.- The cord is REALLY LONG, so if your main desktop/laptop/docking device is far away, it's not a problem.Cons:- I prefer to have a clicking scroll wheel (you can also choose to have the scroll wheel free-scroll with the push of a button). It's kind of loud. Not loud enough to bother anyone while I'm scrolling on a conference call, but louder than the G500.- The bottom part to get to the weights is a little difficult to remove.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2019",7 people found this helpful,"I am unfortunately replacing a mouse I really liked, the Corsair M65, which suffered from a way too early failure. I've used Logitech mice forever and they just keep going, so that'll likely be the last time I venture off to another brand. Comparing these two, they have a very similar size, look and feel. This one is nearly as heavy without the weights as was the M65 with all three weights. I think I liked the M65's aluminum construction a bit better, but the plastic on this one doesn't leave anything to be desired and the grippy material on this mouse sides is a nice touch. This unit's button placement is far superior over the M65, I don't find myself inadvertently activating any buttons like I did with the Corsair. The scroll resistance on this mouse wheel is also a bit better, very defined clicks and it's also adjustable to free spin if desired. It is comfortable enough to use as an every day mouse and has optional features that can be used for gaming. Overall, I think this is a better mouse than the Corsair and so long as it holds up, I'll keep my review at 5 stars.Update: I'm starting to think these rather expensive gaming mice are just a cash grab. The middle mouse button on this one failed to scroll properly after only 29 days of use. Thank goodness I was still within the Amazon return window. Mice have been around for a long time and the tech to make them reliable has also been around for a long time. Something is wrong with the middle mouse button on these gaming mice, this is the second one from two different companies to fail shortly after purchase. I'll get this one replaced, but my next mouse is going to be a cheap one. At least they work reliably for a good long time. This is unacceptable to have premature failures like this on $50 mice when the $12 special will go for a decade.Update 2: The replacement mouse has held up so far, so I'm upgrading the review stars a bit. I do have semi-frequent problems with dust getting stuck in the laser's sensor area. When this happens, I get really bad tracking and have to blow on it to clear whatever's in there. Not super inconvenient, but also not a ""feature"" that I've seen from any other mouse that I've used in 20 years.Update 3: Middle mouse wheel failed at about 16 months, back down to 1 star. I'm done with these expensive mice. I've had mice last 10+ years, but can't get a single ""high-end gaming mouse"" to last even 2 years.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2018",9 people found this helpful,"The mouse specs are straight forward, and covered in the description of the product. However, as a side note, there was no noticeable performance increase with the hero sensor compared to their last generation. That was to be expected since Logitech already had phenomenal sensors so any difference is probably on the test results not human use.That being said, I'll just do a quick pro, con list.Pros:- Solid construction- good button placement- buttons are light, and crisp- Decent support software whether that is Logitech gaming software or the hub.- Comparable price to competitor mice with similar features.Cons:- Scroll wheel is not rubberized like the G900 and is very hard to grip.- There is no comfort groove in the right mouse button like there is with the left (preference)- Mouse is heavy, even without the weights. If you like to do flick shots or lift your mouse up you may feel fatigue over time compared to other Logitech mice that weigh around 75grams.- Edit: There is no support for forward and backward scroll wheel as buttons in their software per this review. Would be nice to have like Roccats swarm software.Conclusion: This is a well priced product. The sensor is incredible, comparable to other brands such as Roccat, Razer, and Steel Series (among others like Zowie). It is heavy, more for larger hands, and the scroll wheel could have been rubber for grip. I'll personally use this for MOBAS and RTS but it is far too heavy for dedicated fps like Overwatch and COD. I'd personally recommend the Logitech G Pro/Pro Hero if you are an FPS player that needs fewer buttons.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Solid choice for people that need more buttons and have larger hands.,Shawn

Still unhappy that the mouse broke so quickly, especially for the price and target use.I purchased the mouse in May 2019. Beginning in March 2020, the mouse started acting funny. The left mouse button would not work correctly in 2 ways: 1) single clicks were sent as double clicks and vice versa, and 2) click-and-drag stopped working. Instead, it acted as if I released the mouse button mid-movement and then clicked again. This would have the effect of dragging a different item than I originally selected.Both of these issues affect gaming, but they also affects work, as dragging formulas in Excel or moving e-mails to folders no longer work. Also, trying to select a word or sentence by double-clicking is nearly impossible.Searching Logitech's forums, this appears to be a known issue, reported by many users.I have contacted Logitech support, but have not received a reply yet.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2019",5 people found this helpful,"I am writing this after having the mouse a day and a half, so things may change. So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM. My previous older gaming mouse had a few different limitations that really stuck out once I went up to higher resolution and could more consistently hold higher frame rates. Basically at the higher display capabilities my old mouse movements looks rather stuttery and jerky. This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning. So for a run down on how this has improved over an older generation gaming mouse is:1. Turned down mouse sensitivity in Windows, Linux, and in games. At the same time turned up DPI resolution on the mouse. The main thing you are really after is turning off ""mouse acceleration"". The difference in smoothness is night and day. I simply did not have the mouse resolution and responsiveness before, at least for first person shooters. With this mouse and a few quick tweaks I do.2. Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces. My older gaming mouse just did not have the sensor for this, so it would stick on the mouse pad a little and then the movement would be a little jerky as it transitioned to kinetic friction. This mouse can do it, so problem solved.3. This mouse allows balancing with weights. I guesstimated where I thought I needed the weights and so far it is working out pretty nice. The previous gaming mouse had a wireless option with a battery in the back and especially with my big hands not making much contact with the back of the mouse, this would cause things to shift around and not track quite right.For my recommendations to get the most out of Linux is to:1. Setup under Windows. The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate.2. In Linux (I am doing this under Ubuntu 18.04, but should work with any distro) first order of business is to disable acceleration. Create the file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.confand enter in the following:Section ""InputClass"" Identifier ""My Mouse"" Driver ""libinput"" MatchIsPointer ""yes"" Option ""AccelProfile"" ""flat"" Option ""AccelSpeed"" ""0""EndSection3. Restart your X server by logging out and back in.4. Make mouse adjustments such as sensitivity levels in X windows and in games and enjoy! The main games to benefit from this are FPS (first person shooter) games. Other games any old mouse will do, but it wasn't those games that pushed you to get this mouse, right?As a summary, even within a few hours of having this mouse I am finding that I am not getting nauseous as much with FPS gaming, movement looks a lot smoother, and I am quickly getting in a lot more shots and especially a lot more sniping head shots. Even in a window manager doing things like grabbing the edge of a window to move it around is a lot easier now.While some may debate whether this mouse is as good as another mouse currently on the market, at least going from an older generation gaming mouse to this one is a big improvement. I suppose my only qualm so far is I fired up the utility in Windows to configure it where Linux is my primary OS. Also while some people say DPI does not matter, it seems like it helps when you turn off mouse acceleration and then use higher DPI resolutions to compensate along with a good polling rate. I would consider the result from this mouse once finding the right settings to be ""perfect tracking"".",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Big improvement over older generation gaming mouse.,BatteryKing
"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019",4 people found this helpful,"Update Aug 29, 2019: I submitted a support ticket to Logitech a week ago, and I have not gotten any response from their support other than the initial confirmation with the support ticket number. The same day I submitted my support ticket I went and bought a SteelSeries Rival 600 to hold me over until I would hopefully receive a replacement from Logitech, but after using the Rival 600 I can say I will not be going back to Logitech for a gaming mouse ever again.TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use.I got the G502 HERO as a replacement to my long time favorite mouse the G502 Proteus Core. The decision to upgrade was due to natural wear on the Proteus Core from over years of use along with the desire to have better software support for managing mouse profiles and settings through the newer Logitech G HUB software.My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured. With the Proteus Core I had been using the Logitech Gaming Software to manage profiles, lights, and configurations but I want to make sure I was using the recommended software with the new HERO mouse. I opted to uninstall the LGS so that I could install G Hub without any worry of problem or conflict between the two pieces of software. When attempting to install G Hub it would get stuck at the ""Downloading and Installing"" part of the installer, and this was after leaving it be for almost an hour. After killing the install process, I scoured my systems for remnants of LGS from AppData folders to Registry entries to make sure I deleted anything that could cause conflict. Upon rebooting I attempted to install G Hub again only to yield the same issue I encountered before all of this taking on Windows 10 Pro 1809 at the time. Since I couldn't get the G Hub software working I figured I would have to reset or reinstall Windows to make sure the software was working with a blank slate, but I was not about to reinstall my whole OS to test that theory just to get my mouse to work so I resorted to reinstalling LGS to get my new HERO mouse configured.Now that the mouse had been configured to my preferred button layout and DPI setting, I was able to starting using it normally. To make sure everything felt normal I quickly went through a couple of my regular games to verify that my muscle memory was still relevant since the HERO is the exactly same form factor as the Proteus Core. The new mouse was proving to be what I had hoped for, barring the earlier dilemma with the software.Over the course of April I occasionally had something very strange happen while in use; at random times without predictors or warning my cursor on screen would shoot to one of the corners of my screen and get pinned there. In FPS games this would cause my character to suddenly start staring at the ground or the sky while rapidly spinning in one direction, indicating that the mouse was perceiving continuous horizontal and vertical inputs despite the mouse being stationary. This could only be interrupted by lifting the mouse off of the mousepad, a CORSAIR MM600, and setting it back down, which would stop the constant input and everything would go back to normal. In over 6 years of gaming on PC, 3 of which were with the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I had never encountered any issue like this with any of the Razer or Logitech mice I had used up to that point.Come mid May the issue had persisted, so I found a day to reinstall Windows 10 to the latest version 1903 in the hopes that finally being able to run the G Hub software would somehow magically fix what I believe to be a sensor issue with the mouse itself. With Windows 10 1903 installed, the G Hub software finally complete its own installation without an issue, but the cursor still continued to randomly get pinned to a corner of the screen without warning.Since I had confidently ruled out software, I decided to contact Logitech support. After explaining everything to the support agent, they decided that they would send me a new replacement mouse which arrived only a few days later. Within only a couple weeks I experienced the cursor issue again with the replacement HERO mouse from Logitech support, but it seemed to happen less often so I dealt with it.It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down.I want to love this mouse, but unless Logitech can improve their QC I cannot recommend them at this time.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Persistent issues,ASBaumgarten

"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2020",3 people found this helpful," Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones.The BAD:This mouse doesn’t glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place. Issue here is the new and NOT improved weight system. Unlike the old push-of-a-button slide out tray on G500, the boomerang shaped weights need to be wedged into the bottom of the mouse once you pop the side corner and peel off the underside. (By the way, this is completely counter intuitive and not mentioned in the tiny sheet of a paper that passes for a “manual”. Instead you are supposed to find an official YouTube video by Logitech describing the procedure. What?! What happened with the button-push system?) The entire door is held, barely at that, by a super weak 1g magnet and two tiny plastic latches that seem like a major part endurance oversight. (No way they won’t break at some point in the future).As reported on reddit and elsewhere, the mouse underside weights compartment door does not close all the way. There is some give and it makes the mouse uneven on the bottom. That said, even removing the weights AND the door entirely, the mouse will still scratch and grate since the mouse feet elsewhere were positioned unevenly ( There are no feet positioned on right side at all for example, which makes the mouse uneven door-issue-aside.). All of this can be mitigated by not using the G502 on a hard surface like wood, glass, or those new “pro-gamer” plastic or metal pads. But even on a cloth mat after a few hours there were tracks and tiny rips in the cloth material. Wow, Logitech!? How the mighty have fallen!Another issue is plastic. Cheap plastic everywhere that is. Nowadays even never-heard-of-brands making “Cool Gamer RGB overload” mice for $10-$15 come with rubberized coating. Other than the side grips, the entirety of G502 is cheap slick plastic which will make the mouse slide around… well, grind around let’s be honest. Also, it has been shrunken in all possible dimensions compared to G500. It is narrower, shorter and much lower than the G500. Seems like something designed for your average teenage/tween hand, which I’m sure is the target demographic now anyway.All in all, all of the above can explained by down-costing. This mouse (G502) screams “cut-costs”, for the manufacturer that is. You, the user, are still expected to pay 2 to 2.5 times as much as you did for the G5 or G500 10-15 years ago while getting something much inferior. Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions. (The underside of the mouse does not shut clean making the bottom of the mouse uneven? How was this overlooked?! And then made by the million?)The GOOD:The sensor is top notch. While not majorly improved, the increase in precision is noticeable and measurable vs G500 for instance. Jitter is lower and bizarre acceleration issues seem to be non-existent on G502. Cord is pretty nice. Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality. Something easily frayed G500 cord could have used. Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English.Summary:Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse. 10 years ago this would have been a… well, still a downgrade to a G500, but not many options were as available back then, so it might have been an option of some kind. Now, even no-name “Gamer-Cool” brands come with decent enough software, (macros, RGB configurability, profiles, DPI tweaking and all), rubberized coating, latest Pixart sensors, weight systems, you name it, all for under $20, sometimes even for under $15. It seems the no-names have gotten a bit better, if not a whole lot better and name brands like Logitech have gotten a bit worse and down-costed to the absolute maximum, so now everything sits in the middle and luck-of-the-draw is what rules the day and the mouse pad.I would say G502 is on par with your average random $15 no-name brand “Gamer-Cool” mouse on Amazon, but even those have rubberized coating, proper height and size for a grown man’s hand, and actual metal feet.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"I'd heard people preaching how good the G502 was for quite awhile, but I was hesitant to try it. Maybe it's the aesthetic or the fact that I usually prefer mice with more buttons (I play a lot of MMOs) but I tried a lot of alternatives before I finally decided to give in an try the G502, but boy do I wish I had just done so sooner. After having used the Logitech G Pro mouse for the last year, I decided I was ready to try something different. Don't get me wrong, the Pro is a great mouse, but it's very lightweight which I didn't find terribly comfortable to use (it makes sense in the Pro gamer context, though, so I get it.) The G502 is perfect. It's hefty, and you can customize it using the weights. The button placement is nearly perfect (I find the thumb button a tad hard to reach for my hands) and, like the Pro, the Hero engine is incredibly accurate and satisfying to use. I've ended up using it as my all day mouse, even for work, as it's just so pleasant in the hand. If you're looking for a great mouse at a very reasonable price point, give the G502 a try.

The left one double clicks almost every time I click it (already attempted several ""fixes"" but it appears to be the hardware as nothing the all knowing google has to suggest has worked) and the left one will not maintain a click when I hold it down (for games such as Call of Duty this is detrimental as I am unable to maintain a zoom in with scopes).Because of this, I am lowering my 5-star review to 2 stars.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019",One person found this helpful,"First off, I'm biased. I've been using the Proteus Core version for 2-3 years. Bought back when they were in the $100 range. Loved the mouse. So naturally its hard not to go for the updated version for $41 since mine is getting ragged. Saw that the special edition was $29 but not digging the black and white scheme. Much rather have the all black and since that was the only difference, I paid the extra $12 for the regular version. Weird.Honestly I really wanted to go to a the wireless G502 but since its literally a $110 up charge ($41 vs $149) for being cordless, theres no way. Shame on you Logitech for being ridiculous in your cordless pricing. Oh well. I'm happy as every with my new G502 and should be for another 2-3 years I imagine.**EDIT** 12/25/19Have to send this back for a replacement. The mouse wheel buttons are defective. If you press down on the middle mouse button it presses the left and right side wheel buttons as well (randomly). The left and right wheel buttons are ridiculously sensitive to the slightest touch. They even get pressed when I'm just using the wheel and not meaning to press a button. Really hoping this is a defect in this particular mouse and not a widespread problem with the new HERO line of the G502. My old G502 has no issue with this whatsoever even after years of hard use.**EDIT** 12/27/19First off, big ups to AMAZON for sending me a replacement so quickly! Great customer service. Bad news is it seems the issue I am having wasn't a one off problem. You literally can't click the middle mouse button without clicking a left or right side wheel click simultaneously. I hope I am explaining this right. I guess it would be buttons 10 and 11 that depress when you push the mouse wheel left or right. I bind all 11 mouse buttons for games and nearly every time I click the middle mouse, it clicks button 10 or 11 as well.

The programmable buttons on this mouse have weak action and are easy to press by accident. The previous logitech mouse I used for years (sadly no longer available) worked much better. I would be willing to put up with this inferior replacement for its predecessor except after a couple of weeks it started misbehaving. The cursor would start randomly moving. The mouse was sending a continual ""right"" or ""up"" or other signal to the computer. Sometimes the mouse would return to normal use with some vigorous scrolling. Sometimes I would have to disconnect/reconnect the USB to get it to work again. The final straw was when I accidentally deleted a document when the mouse decided to move just as I was clicking.I looked around the internet and apparently this has been a common problem for years that Logitech cannot be bothered to fix. I tried seven ""solutions"" to the problem including new drivers, new firmware, and turning off power saving features.

I needed one that was heavy, thick, had lots of buttons and was solid. Corsair has constantly let me down with going through over 9 mice in just under three years between two people on several rigs. Razer is usually overpriced and doesn't feel that great. Logitech comes in clutch.This thing is built like a tank. It's heavy. It's solid. It has tons of program options, and the software is a joy to work with. The RGB LEDs are fully programable. The cable feels pretty solid. It's accurate. The control of the mouse is great. Three clickers is the new norm. Getting used to it takes about two to three days, but when you do, its like wow, why didn't we normalize this sooner.I play league and wow, genshin impact, stardew valley, and almost any survival horror game that comes out.

I really wanted a mouse with extra buttons directly adjacent to the M1 or M2 button like the g300s had and this one has two next to the M1 button and a couple of thumb buttons.Weight: Medium to heavy depending on weights added. There is a hinged magnetic ""door"" on the bottom of the mouse that makes it extremely easy to adjust the weight of the mouse on a whim. My g300s was ultra lightweight, which made flick shots extremely easy but glidey tracking wasn't perfectly smooth. This one glides extremely well and flicks well with the weights taken out. Adding too much weight can cause overshoot or a kind of rubber banding effect when I throw my hand quickly, but more weight feels like it has easier gliding and tracking.Features: This has things like profile shifting and a temporary dpi shift ""sniper"" button but I never use those. It does have a scroll wheel lock and unlock button that lets you choose between the clicky single line scrolling or the friction free high speed scrolling, which I change all the time as needed. Usually for browsing.Software: Let's you change your lights, button assignments, make macros, etc. The usual.Cons: The only minor con is that the scroll wheel very slightly jiggles when flicking the mouse quickly. It has never caused me problems, but I can feel it when it happens. I fixed it by using a thin nylon washer with a slit cut in it so I could lower it on the ""axle"" the scroll wheel is attached to.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020",One person found this helpful,"G502 Hero Mouse from Logitech, Review.I've been buying the ""Inferior"", non-""sick!"" G300s several years.I've owned owned a total of three G300's.Even though the G300s physically decay like cake in the rain, I strongly recommend buying a G300s instead of this G502 piece of absolute garbage.LET ME EXPLAIN:To start, the Hand-Feel for me is really bad, and I usually end up holding it in a way that makes reaching two of the Thumb buttons very awkward.I normally get Ambidextrous mice , so that's my fault.And really, it's also my fault for having strange hands.But that's not what makes the G502 the worst mouse I've touched in over a decade.NEGATIVES:What is NOT my fault is the overly sensitive Click Pressure on all the face and side buttons.I don't know if that's an intended feature, or I just got mouse from a lot that was over-tuned.But it's far too easy to accidentally click when sliding the mouse across the pad.ANY resistance from your surface and CLICK!Glance any part of a button that isn't the exact center: CLICK!Gently feel for where the buttons are in the dark, while being careful to use far less force than should reasonably be needed to depress a button far enough to engage the mechanism : CLICK! CLICKCLICK! CLICK.MORE NEGATIVES:The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare.The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states.Beyond the fact that it is an unwanted feature at the best of times -- when gaming, it will actively hinder your enjoyment and performance -- unless you dedicate your life mastering it, and I have no intention of doing anything remotely close to that.* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness.Unless you just want to rip-scroll through several pages of product reviews on Amazon to record for a video project, it has no use case that is superior to any other scrolling function available to users, and that includes the Middle Mouse Button scrolling that the mouse still possesses (I'll get to MMB issues later).* As a tick wheel, it FAILS because the ratchet is far too loose to be trusted.You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will ""back rock"" or fore rock"" to cradle itself between the teeth.This then causes your scroll selection to tick up or down onto something other than your intent.Not always, mind you.But enough (and unpredictably so) to seriously impede, if not, ruin whatever gaming moment you might have been having.Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor.Not with your OS, not with G HUB, not with ANYTHING...You can only change how your Operating System MULTIPLIES the Wheel Motion.And even with a 1:1 multiple, you get that selection rocking issue.And anything LESS than 1:1 results in no scrolling whatsoever unless you unlock and rip-scroll.MOAR NEGATIVES:Oh and this is all before the issues of trying to get a clean Click out of the Middle Mouse Button buried under this infernal, Chroenburgian assembly.It feels like trying to command a Two year old into behaving, using only soft verbal warnings, while sliding supine across a frozen lake, while also being used as hockey puck by competing teams of various drunken Canadian bears and moosen.This would be an absolutely great mouse to lend to your competition.if this was the design intent, hat's off to ya.But, to put everything I've said even more viscerally...I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed.It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature.But this wheel, I HATE IT.I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it.NEVER REVISIT THIS DESIGN EVER AGAIN.You just don't get it.It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse.Even the tasks that have nothing to do with scrolling at all.The fact that you know this boobytrap is a centimeter from your finger is all it takes.Oh yeah. AND IT'S LOUD!It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise.NO!Shifting a from 4th Gear to Reverse at Highway speed in your uncle's rustbucket Camaro is less audibly jarring!POSITIVES:The software is actually fairly good.With the caveat that you cannot change the Wheel DPI nor the Wheel Up/Down command assignments (wth?).The Motion is spot on, but that's baseline expectation for a +$50 MouseAnd the Weight system is a fine option, even if I'm most comfortable taking all the wrights AND THE DOOR off.CONCLUSION:The G502, in my humble opinion (at least THIS one I personally received) may as well be eWaste.I genuinely tried ""Getting Used to It"".I gave the thing several months.But as a result, I can no longer return it.Seriously, Logitech.If you would just use the G502's Software, Motion Sensor and Moulded Plastic Quality for the next iteration of the G300s series: I'd buy that day one.Give the next G300s a SOLID wheel with a strong ratchet and Side-Pivot lateral scrolling.You could even toss in a Thumb Toggle/Switch for DPI shifting or whatever.All these things have mechanically solid examples in your other products.Paint the dang thing Gold, charge $80, and call it the ""G399gg Great Golden Calf Edition"".I don't care.Just stop with these ridiculously over-designed ""srz gam3r"" fad features.YOU. ARE. NOT. RAZER.YOU. SHOULD. BE. BETTER. THAN. RAZER.PS.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021",One person found this helpful,"I am so very disappointed with this mouse, so-called one of the best gamer mouse at the moment. I couldn't stand using it for more than an hour, and had to switch back to my cheap, 6-year-old, discontinued, MSI Interceptor DS200. I wish I've done more research before buying and did not get carried away with the gamer community reviews.There are two main reasons for me not liking this mouse: the wheel (which is poorly designed in many ways) and the Logitech software.In almost every other aspect the mouse is very good. It looks great, very comfortable for the hand, and the thumb button setup is just perfect.THE WHEEL, OMG THE WHEEL...How a little part can be so flawed to totally ruin the experience? The very first thing you will notice when you unbox the mouse is that the wheel is released and will spin freely. After freaking out for a second you will also notice that there is a button that will lock the wheel allowing for the use we all like and need.However, there are three problems with the locked wheel: The first is that it is extremely noisy, more than you can imagine. The second is that it does not scroll easily, the movement is not smooth at all. And the third is that the wheel is made of metal, which causes your finger to slide occasionally (when the wheel is locked) and miss a few scrolls, which is a big flaw.And finally, there is the rattling sound. As soon as you start moving the mouse with moderate speed you will feel like something is loose in the inside. It is the wheel, again, moving from side to side, clashing against the plastic, and this is very, very annoying. There are some YouTube tutorials that teach you how to stick a tape on the side to prevent the rattling. Although I'm not into cheap hacks to my new hardware I was about to accept all these flaws and try to get used to them as soon as possible. But then I met the Logitech software problem...LOGITECH VS LOGITECHI have a Logitech G910 keyboard which I love and I have been using for quite some time, along with the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS). The LGS is supposed to detect your Logitech hardware and let you configure all of them from one place. However, despite my efforts LGS never detected my G502 mouse.That left me no choice but to download and install G-Hub, a newer Logitech software that is supposed to be better than LGS. But it's not, It's actually much worse, although it did detect my keyboard and my mouse.G-Hub is poorly designed, it is bugged and it is missing many cool features that LGS had, making a hassle out of the simpler tasks like coloring your keyboard for a specific game, or keeping a custom default DPI for the mouse. Also, the import feature for your LGS profiles is just broken. G-Hub wont import anything and you will lose all your LGS customizations and macros.Ok, I thought: maybe I can use G-Hub for the mouse and LGS for the keyboard. Nope, Logitech wont let you use both, and as soon as you install G-Hub it will block LGS.I was not keen to ruin my experience with the G-910 in order to use a flawed mouse, so I decided I will not use the G502 for now.I live outside of the US and getting a refund is not an option.

This mouse was great...while it lasted. About 6 months after purchasing, the mouse lost the ability to hold a left-click. In other words, you'd click and hold the left mouse button to drag something, but the mouse would let off the hold even though you were still holding the left mouse button down. This makes any task that involves dragging and dropping (or drawing something by holding the left mouse button) infuriating if not impossible. After reading around, it sounds like it's a known hardware issue with this mouse. Unfortunately, Logitech's support answer is to try spraying compressed air in the mouse to clear any debris - this did not work.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I just cannot figure out why mouse design engineers do not consider the requirement that a mouse needs to be lifted off the pad and repositioned back to where the user's hand/wrist is not in an uncomfortable position. Also, what to do when one runs out of mouse pad? Why, lift the mouse and bring it back to the middle, of course.The G502 is a great mouse except it's difficult to use without activating one of the G4 or G5 buttons, especially when lifting to reposition. One of the reasons for this is the sides of the mouse body are too straight up and down which cause ones fingers to slide up. Coupled with the thumb scoop area being too small--even in normal use, ones thumb is very close to those buttons-- that in the heat of battle, they're far, far, too easy to accidentally press and, poof, you lost that battle.Overall the mouse seems robustly built but I feel that all of the switches activate with too light and too shallow of a press.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020",One person found this helpful,"After 12 years, my MADCATZ mouse finally gave up the ghost, and I needed a replacement gaming mouse. As my budget now is much more limited, and MADCATZ isn't what it used to be, I chose to go with this one based on reviews I had read online. It has performed quite well, and with my large hands, the fit is pretty good.The only issue I have had, as have others, is the middle wheel/button. It is very easy to mis-click with it, and hit one of the side buttons when trying to click the center. I highly recommend not using the center or wheel side buttons for anything essential in the game, as in the heat of a big battle, the odds of you hitting the wrong ability are pretty high. I keep the utility abilities on the middle button. The scroll function is good, and it's nice to be able to turn off the wheel clicker for free scrolling when I want. However the side buttons on the wheel don't have a definite on/off click to them, and there is a sort of light clickyness as you move it side to side, almost like a two stage switch with a single function, and the angle of your finger can cause it to very easily trigger it, especially if you have used it recently for one of the side functions, and it's in the first stage. I have found that to ensure the right button is hit, that I have to stretch my finger flat over the wheel to ensure that I get a true straight down motion. Given this, as well as the placement of the other buttons, I wouldn't recommend this mouse to anyone with small hands, especially as there is no adjustment capability. With adjustment capability and a better middle button/scroll, this would be a 6 star mouse.As for the rest, it integrates perfectly into my Logitech software for my G13 as well as any other Logitech hardware I may pick up in the future, and they work well together. I have had no tracking issues, and as I use a rather large HD TV as a monitor, it was simple to adjust tracking for a comfortable fit to my large screen while still keeping fine control over game movement. I don't regret buying and using this mouse. I haven't had it very long, so I can't speak to longevity, but at this price point, I would be very surprised to get 12 years of heavy use out of it, though I do expect it to last a while, as I have had vey good experiences with Logitech hardware over the years.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great gaming mouse, let down by a less than stellar middle button",Faelwolf

It lasted a long while, no issues, and it's what has sold me on keeping on with Logi products. Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled.What's wrong with this new G502? Plenty.It just started up, and it's a doozy. The mouse, when sitting still, sends signals to my PC to move my cursor, when... I'm not even... touching the mouse?

"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020",One person found this helpful,"So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.Update:Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"I am writing this review after about 6 months of using this mouse. I bought this mouse as a replacement for my M720 Triathlon, which I had used for about a year and a half before then. The issue I had with the Triathlon was that it began to double click items when I only clicked them once, and I could no longer drag and drop objects across my desktop without the mouse ""dropping"" them along the way, despite the fact that I was still holding the button.When this mouse began showing the same symptoms, I was disheartened to say the least, especially so since the mouse was out of the return window, but less than a year old. I looked into the issue deeper and found that the culprit was the Omron switches used inside the mouse, for the left and right click. A number of people had suggested switching them for Kailh GM 4.0 switches, so I decided to fix this mouse instead of buying a new one. I bought four of the Kailh switches, and I and a friend replaced the old Omrons in both my G502 Hero and my M720 Triathlon, and now they both work flawlessly.The cause of the double-click bug is due to a technical oversight in the switches longevity when in a newer, more power-conservative circuit, I was told. I found it strange, however, upon opening the mouse to replace the switches, that the DPI Up & Down buttons, as well as the side DPI Button on the G502 Hero all use Kailh switches, while the left and right still use the Omrons. This is likely due to the Omron switches having been considered the higher quality option, at the time of this mouses inception, but by that point, I am certain Logitech was already aware of the issues that switch was facing.If you can replace the switches, either by yourself or with some help, I can recommend this mouse, otherwise, expect to replace it within two years, most likely.UPDATE: 9 Months InAfter a few months since my review, it is now April, and the Hyperscroll feature of the device stopped working abruptly. I hadn't done anything to merit this, it simply quit. After dismantling the mouse (again), I found that the interior mechanism which allows switching between Hyperscrolling and traditional scrolling (which lets the scroll wheel spin freely) is a simple spring and a pin, with a plastic paddle, and a small gear system that allows the switch from one mode to another. When the paddle is engaged, it pushes the pin away from the scroll wheel, which allows the wheel to spin without clicking. When disengaged, the pin is pushed against the scroll wheel, which causes the familiar click/bump of scrolling. Pretty simple, except that whoever designed this mechanism didn't account for a few important aspects: The spring they used is about 4x too weighty for the job, and the pin is held in by... hope? I guess? there really isn't anything stopping the pin from moving side to side, and it can move too far from the paddle, meaning that when the paddle goes to make contact enough to push the pin away, it goes right by, and the scroll clicks regardless, as there's nothing to push it away from the wheel.Since the spring has way too much tension for its purpose, it does do an excellent job at one thing: pushing the pin right out of place. Two millimeters of plastic, on the edge of the paddle, to hold the pin in, would have stopped this, or making the pin go the whole way through, and adding a second mount on the other side of the wheel, to hold it in place. I can think of at least ten different ways to prevent this pin from sliding. Unlike the Omron switches, which I can forgive as a possible oversight, as the choice to use them was likely misinformed with out dated information, the issues plaguing the scroll wheel should have been addressed before the mouse even reached production, as this is an easily noticed and easily amended flaw.All of these issues have driven my rating of this device from 5 stars, to 4 stars, and now 2 stars. I give the device 2 stars because, at the end of the day, it is user serviceable, and I like Logitech. I've had good experiences with their products every single time I've bought them until now, and its very unfortunate that this is the first thing I've bought from them that has disappointed me. I cannot recommend this mouse.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Omron Switches and Scroll Wheel Issues, Avoid this Mouse!",Amazon Customer
"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"**Updated review**Amazon replaced the mouse because Logitech was being difficult about honoring their warranty.So the 2nd mouse had the same software issue as the original review but I had found a work around for the custom key assignments by using registry edits to let the mouse work with the older software.Unfortunately this 2nd mouse has now developed the double click problem that many Logitech mice are prone to because they use cheap micro switches for the clicking mechanism.Honestly I'm just going to switch to a different brand that uses better switches even though I've been using Logitech mice for over 20 years.**Original review**I upgraded from an old G502 spectrum to this mouse.FIrst of all the good things, it's of good quality construction and fits extremely well in my hand. It slides fairly smoothly over my mouse pad and overall it's a pleasure to use.The bad?It is not compatible with Logitech Gaming Software and instead needs to be used with G-HUB in order to customize it's settings.G-HUB is.. not so good.G-HUB prevents the left/right wheel click from continuous horizontal scrolling like I could with the G502 Spectrum on LGS. (not to be confused with the vertical scroll wheel)I can't assign custom key assignments to the mouse while using onboard-memory mode, it only works when onboard-memory is not turned on.You can create a custom profile and then assign it to one of the 5 memory slots, but custom key assignments are for some reason not saved and/or applied.What's the point of allowing 5 custom on-the-fly profiles to be assigned if they are not going to let you use custom key assignments?It's one of the main features if the mouse that simply won't work because G-HUB doesn't work properly.Logitech should enable compatibility with LGS or fix G-HUB.Honestly I wish I could just get my money back.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,GHUB.. why?,Jessica
"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021",One person found this helpful,"So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.First is the design:The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.Second is the software:The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.Third is the delivery:It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Awesome mouse,David Britt

"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2020",One person found this helpful,"This mouse was great, until it started having a left click problem. Occasionally when using left click it sets off several rapid clicks at once, and would do the same when the mouse button is held. No problem I thought, this has a 2 year warranty. Except there is a problem. Their support policies imply their customers are automatically dishonest and put a large burden on their customers to prove otherwise. Aside from standard troubleshooting steps I was asked to go to a website to test the mouse clicker, no problem. It was registering plenty of extra clicks. Then I continued reading, and saw they wanted video evidence which met certain requirements:""Video needs to show the website on the screen and the mouse (physically and not just the cursor) together with a handwritten note of the ticket number at the same time.""This blew my mind! They wanted me to do this while recording it all with my phone! So I express my dissatisfaction with this and note that not everyone even has the means to do this, took a screenshot of the website and attached it. This convinced the agent to go ahead and replace the mouse anyway, but even so the additional demands are frustrating. I am being asked to destroy the product and provide photo evidence before they send the replacement. So I have a mouse that is frustrating to use but at least it is better than no mouse, and they want me to destroy it before they send me a replacement. I'll have no mouse for days. The requirements for the evidence:Before the replacement product will be released, we request that you permanently disable your current product in a safe manner and provide us with pictures of the complete, disabled product from three different angles, one of these pictures should clearly show the product details such as PID/SN, and include a handwritten note with your case number (XXXXXXX) in each of the photos.I again expressed my dissatisfaction and that I need to use the mouse until the new one arrives. If I end up having to do this I'll be buying a new mouse from a company with better support before I follow through with disabling the mouse and getting the replacement I should have already gotten.EDIT: The agent went ahead and shipped the new mouse without requiring evidence of disabling the old mouse. I could have waited a day to see their response but I was pretty frustrated. While it is a shame I had to complain to get around these requirements they still accommodated me, so I've given back 3 stars for a 4 star rating.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I bought this mouse in summer 2019, giving Logitech one last go after having at the time just lost yet another Logitech mouse to the double-click issue. I thought maybe a $50 mouse would be made of some tougher stuff, but it began double-clicking occasionally after only 6 months. A year later, it has gotten to the point that I am looking for a replacement. I am also having issues with the scroll wheel failing to register when I attempt to scroll up, a problem I've never had with any other mouse before.For those not in the know, the issue I'm talking about causes the mouse to register multiple clicks from one tap of the left mouse button, causing double-clicks when you intend to do single clicks, and randomly registering additional clicks while attempting to click and drag. It doesn't happen on every click, but as the mouse ages, it happens more and more until it is eventually unusable. This is caused by Logitech using cheap switches that break quickly, and despite years of people complaining about this, they have not done anything about it, I guess because it's a net win for them as long as the warranty has expired before the problem starts.At this point I am convinced that the only way to avoid this problem is to find another brand for my next mouse.

I prefer a palm grip but will sometimes use a claw grip and holding the mouse is comfortable either way. The G502 is more on the heavy side for a mouse and I don't see a need to use any of the included weights. The mass of this mouse could be an issue for some people, as they may notice some fatigue with constantly moving the mouse around. I'd say the only issues I've had so far have been getting the cable trained to lay how I want it and acclimating to the scroll wheel being a smooth metal surface rather than rubberized. Coming from a G500s, I miss the rubberized scroll wheel but not enough for this to be a major issue for me now that I'm used to the smoother metal. The cable takes a few days to fully train, depending on what shape it needs to be. Straightening it was simple enough and getting it to maintain a curve wasn't terribly hard. Within a week, I had the cable situated mostly how I wanted it.Gaming and general usage so far have been great. The range of DPI settings mean I can set exactly the speed I want and the DPI switching buttons are great for people who prefer having a few options for movement and aiming. The sensor seems to work on just about any normal desk surface. I've used mine on a couple mouse pads, wood, and glass.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"I am extremely disappointed with this mouse. If you had asked me just one month ago what I thought of it, I'd say ""Great!"" It worked beautifully, it was very comfortable, and I liked all of the easy to access buttons on the side of the mouse.Earlier this month, I started to notice that the right mouse button wasn't detecting when I clicked. It seemed to do this randomly, and I'm still not certain if it makes a difference where I press down on the button. It seemed like if I kept my finger dead center, it was a little more consistent. Now even that doesn't work. The only thing that seems to reliably get it to detect the click is pressing down VERY hard whenever I right click. In addition, starting yesterday I ran into the same issue others have described where it double-right clicks with only a single click of the button. It's getting to the point where a number of games are becoming almost unplayable, so I have to replace the thing.Words cannot begin to express my disappointment. I bought some cheap 20$ mouse with less than 4 stars in review and it was one of my favorite gaming mice of all time, lasted me at least a couple of years. This mouse was more expensive and lasted a measly six months, if that. To add insult to injury, I didn't buy the extended protection plan, and the time to replace it has run out. So it looks like I'm stuck with it.It is possible that what I've experienced is a freak incident. It's possible that this was a ""One in a million"" scenario. Maybe no one else will run into this, maybe I wouldn't run into it again if I bought a new one. But it doesn't really matter, because in this case I'm the one.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Good well made mouse.Packaging and shipping was excellent.I had to give this mouse away though because it is just too large and uncomfortable for my hand size. I also would prefer more buttons.Size :I found the back of my hands hurting after using the mouse.The ""hump"" or curve of the mouse seems high, making it a reach for the far left side button (default aim). This means I likely would not use it, bringing the amount of extra buttons down (at least for me). Although, my fingers did seem to automatically find the perfectly located middle back button. I never once hit the front middle accidentally.Perhaps because one button was too far and just the sheer size of the mouse, i did find that my fingers would sort of expect the four left buttons to be far as well, causing me reach further then they actually were and mis-press.To be clear, those four and the middle back buttons are perfectly located so this is just me.Buttons:The amount they state does not include the middle front button which serves as the switch for your scroll wheel (either free rolling or click... both are great!). While I like the option to choose this, I world have prefered having another mappable middle button like my current device.Two of the mappable buttons are your scroll wheel left and right tilt.This is cool but I felt it would have been better with more noticeable feedback like a soft click. The wheel felt almost loose and I am curious if I would have ended up mistakenly clicking to the left or right while trying to just middle click.I honestly think I wouldnt and it's just a matter of the user to get used to it.Overall, a cool looking and good quality mouse with a few expertly placed buttons.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.Weight and SizeThe G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)ProsRubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnetThe cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.Mouse clicks are very light and responsiveThe number of buttons makes it a productivity machineThumbrest is supportiveThe sensor is completely flawless, no odd trackingYou can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?ConsRGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harshWhen shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattleThe mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dustWhile the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.DPI button could be shifted back littleThe optional weights are almost completely uselessPerformanceThe mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.FINAL VERDiCTDon't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I love this mouse! I doubt that it is for everyone but I purchased two of them. One for home, and one for the office. This mouse comes with weights and the bottom comes off so you can add them to your liking. I only added 2 weights but I could easily see someone else not wanting to add any at all. I like a fast mouse but I find that when I have a light-weight mouse it makes it a bit more difficult to be accurate when pointing. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do but after using it at home for months I had to get one to use at work because a standard office mouse just isn't cutting it. The scroll wheel can be unlocked and can spin freely. This is great for scrolling all the way down on a PDF or just getting to the bottom of a page on a website.

I couldn't afford the wireless edition and really didn't want to deal with cords, but it's not a big deal now that I have it. The moment I unboxed this and held it, I could clearly feel and see how high quality the components are. Left and right click have a certain smoothness to them that I haven't felt on another mouse. The RGB customization is a nice plus, but it doesn't offer that much in the way of options. The infinite scroll wheel is dope and has already changed the game for my mindless reddit scrolling. I also like that the scroll wheel is made of metal, it just feels nice when you rotate it and feel the snap when it's not on the infinite scroll setting. Finally, this thing offers a sensor that is as smooth as butter. I ordered this with a hard mouse pad and dang.

This won't affect everyone... but if you have the wrong mousepad, this mouse will not function properly for you, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it, except go buy new mousepads until you get one that works. It will lose tracking frequently on the wrong surface, and the only option is to change the surface you use until you find one it deems suitable.Edit: 8 months in, the gaming mouse is shot.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2020",One person found this helpful,"____________________CONS_____________________weight:This mouse is too heavy for actual competitive gaming. When you try to flick with this mouse, chances are you'll overaim and miss due to the leftover inertia the mouse had. The fact that logitech would add attachable weights just blows my mind. I've been using this mouse for the better part of a year now, and looking back at it, I regret that I didn't just buy a steelseries mouse instead.curvature of the mouse:This could just be a ME problem, but my hands are fairly average-sized. This mouse's curvature makes it so that in order to get a comfortable grip, your pinky and ring finger are forced to hang off the side and drag on my desk. If logitech added the thumb-rest bit, why couldn't they do the same for the pinky and ring finger?reliability:This could also just be a ME problem. I game a lot with this mouse, and so far it's held up great. However, some days the left mouse button (lmb) and right mouse button (rmb) would just stop working properly. For example, spraying a gun in CS:GO. If holding down the lmb, it would stutter and would stop shooting mid-spray. I've died countless times to this issue, and the same goes the the rmb. I don't abuse this mouse, never dropped it from even above KNEE height, and that's coming from a dude who's 5'7''._____________________PROS_____________________extremely customizable:Installing logitech G-hub is little to no hassle, and making macros makes using this mouse extremely fun. The feel of the material doesn't feel cheap at all (which for an 80$ mouse should be a given) and the curve of the mouse feels great on my hand.visually satisfying:it looks sleek and, for lack of a better word, cool. Nothing I could say could possibly change this.cool scroll button:you can toggle it between going by intervals or just flat-out spinning like a wheel. Pretty useful for any tasks that require spamming inputs really quickly._____________________CONCLUSION_____________________is it worth 80 bucks? No. You'd be better off buying a lighter mouse from steelseries, or maybe even a logitech g pro wireless when it goes on discount. Point is, the g502 hero is one of the worse mice you can get from logitech. Not worst, worse.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2019",One person found this helpful,"Pros: Basically everything. Great response time, great customization for mouse functions, feels great in the hand, all around great. I love how it looks, I love it in almost every way, so just because the cons list is longer, doesn't mean its not an incredible mouse. Cons: Two cons: 1. The weights fit very tightly in both the mouse and the case, and they're kind of annoying to put in and take out. 2. The RGB customization is not that great. You can only do 3 effects, one of which you have no choice of colors, but RGB is probably the least important part of the mouse, so not a bug deal. And one issue that I think was just because mine was a bit faulty, the color of the RGB is off. When I set it to white (R255 G255 B255) it appears blueish green. to make it look white, I have to set it to R255 G160 B160, and then it looks like a perfect white. So I think the red lighting is weak, so I gets overpowered by the Green and blue. Another example of this is when I set it to yellow, it appears green with a tint of yellow. Keep in mind, the cons were just minor things. Weights fitting weird, slight RGB issues, etc. are not big things, don't let them keep you from buying this mouse. This is an incredible product, I've tried other mice, and I would always go with the G502 series without hesitation, and they are by far the most comfortable mice I've ever held. And with this many buttons, you would think that some of them would be really annoying to press, right? Nope. A couple are a little uncomfortable, but at least 10 are quite easy and comfortable to press. There's a reason that the G502 series is so popular, after all.

You have to mash down hard with your index finger (or thumb) in order to use it as your third button, and you have to mash down and push hard with your index finger to turn the wheel (when not in free-spin mode).

At first glance it seemed to help in certain situations with mouse movement, but it wasn't so much different at all.What I like about this mouse is the speed you can set your pointer at. There are also some other nik-nacks I like about this mouse that I don't want to go forever on about. I got this for about 55 dollars and I had a gift card with the purchase.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2019",16 people found this helpful,"I have no idea why Amazon wants me to rate the battery life on this wired mouse. That was kind of weird.In any case, this is a continued evolution of the G502 mouse, which debuted as the Proteus Core, then the Proteus Spectrum before being released as the Hero. The Spectrum introduced RGB lighting to the fold and the Hero introduces the improved Hero sensor, otherwise, all 3 variants are virtually identical aside from a couple aesthetic touches (the Core has some blue accents on it and the Hero has a slightly different G logo).In terms of performance, if you've used any of the previous G502 mice before, it won't feel much different to you. In fact, there's very little reason to upgrade to this unless you just happen to have the money to spare. The Hero sensor is an improved sensor, but I wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between this and the previous sensor. I still use the Spectrum version on my other build and the Core at work, and they all feel the same.Mouse design is the same, button placement is the same, and overall, it feels the same.Which is great because the G502 is just a great mouse, unless you like light mice. It is already on the heavy side and can be made heavier with weights that Logitech includes. For competitive shooters, this mice probably isn't ideal, but if you like heavier mice, this one fits the bill. I like a heavy mouse, so it works for me.Button clicks are responsive and satisfying and the metallic scroll wheel is one of my favorites. The ability to adjust DPI on the fly is nice, as is the sniper button on the side right in front of where your thumb would rest. It has a number of different buttons that can be completely adjusted in the Logitech Gaming Software and the RGB lighting is not nearly as intrusive as on some mice and can be completely disabled if you wish.Some complain about the braided cable snagging, but I have not readily run into this issue much. In fact, it's only an issue when I leave something on my desk for it to snag on.I really like this mouse, but as with anything else, it isn't for everyone. But I personally would recommend it, especially if you like heavier mice.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Slight improvements to an already great mouse,David T. Kreal
"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2019",One person found this helpful,"I've used Logitech products since I was in middle school (I'm around 30 now) so I know this company has had time to work through what makes a good mouse. The texturized feel (I'm a sucker for grippy textures), the sleek look, the hyper scroll option, the ""sniper"" button, the braided cable, switching DPI settings on the fly (with lighting to indicate the current DPI setting), changing the weight and this many programmable G-keys are all in one, reasonably priced, package.Could we ask for more? Sure, it could have more G-keys, more RGB lighting, and lighting settings, be lighter and more ergonomic, but this is the gaming mouse for me. I do wish the wireless version wasn't an extra $100 with a $100 charging mousepad, but if I were made of money, I would have just bought all that instead. That's a small compromise considering that you can get this mouse for $30 - $50 on sale - considering the quality of this mouse - that's an insane deal. Go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Close to perfection,Samuel Clemens
"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Aight so I got my first g502 years ago and it was amazing, best mouse ever until the rmb stopped working. So I didnt want to spend another 80 bucks for a new one so I got one of these for 40. First mouse the scroll wheel was SOOO loose and if you play anything that has quick movements you will notice it and its very annoying. Second the thumb rest is lifted from the bottom of where the little plastic plate is to hold in the weights, and it creates long sharp bump on the edge of the rest that is very very annoying to feel. So I refunded it (Which took me so long to repackage because of how the wire goes in) and got another one. Mouse had the same thing which my other g502 didnt have and my 2 other friends dont have and its very very annoying. If you have a small hand and dont swipe your mouse often then get it would be great. I think that these are refurbished or something because the metal weights also come out as almost black. They look very old.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,sooooo annoying,Ethan W

"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020",258 people found this helpful,"I purchased this in September 2019. By March 2020, I noticed it had horrible double-clicking issues. I probably would have noticed it sooner as I started working from home due to the Coronavirus and was actually using my PC daily.Save yourself the time and money. The sensor is faulty and poor quality. The issue is rampant as you can see in the reviews. Don't risk it and if you purchased one recently, get it returned inside the return window.It is a shame considering that the original G502 is such a great mouse that I still have it and used to use it daily at my office.I would recommend Razer Basilisk v2 Wired Gaming Mouse. It is almost an exact copy of this mouse but with a better implemented sensor (optical sensor) which will not result in the same problems that the G502 HERO suffers with the mechanical sensor.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Faulty Mechanical Sensor - PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS MOUSE!,ZerOxShadows
