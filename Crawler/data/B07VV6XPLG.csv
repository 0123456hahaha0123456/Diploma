24 people found this helpful,Mikey,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020","I wanted to add some pictures but that feature doesn't seem to be present anymore. They were easy to install. I really liked the flat plug. The 18"" included linking cord was just long enough for the two I bought to go around a relatively dark corner under my kitchen cabinets. You can buy a shorter 12"" or longer linking cords up to 120"". The part numbers are included with your installation manual.My problem, and the reason I returned these, is that 2700K is a pretty warm light. In fact, it's REALLY yellow. I tried to like them but every time I walked in the kitchen I was like, ""WHOA, that's a yellow light!"". I ended up returning these and bought the same brand lights that have three different color temp selections. If I had only one color temp to choose from in an under-counter kitchen setting, I think I'd prefer at least a 3000-3600K.",Very Yellow.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
13 people found this helpful,Joan,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","I seldom give reviews but this product warrants comment. I am a retired consulting electrical engineer and specified and approved $millions worth of lighting systems over the years. This fixture is beautifully made and works great for low acuity tasks in the dimmed mode and is good for high acuity tasks at full power. The color rendering is good and the color temperature is pleasingly warm. The form is compact enough to fit nicely behind a minimal valance board under a cabinet. With only a 1-1/4"" valance on our existing cabinets the fixture is completely hidden from view unless you practically lay your head on the counter below. All in all this is the best under cabinet light I've seen and would be specifying them for commercial projects if still working. Oh and yes the price is excellent.",Perfect Residential Undercabinet Light,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
11 people found this helpful,Teri,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020",I like the low and narrow profile of these lights! Also there are two brightness levels on a switch rather than a dimmer. With LED lights sometimes a dimmer causes flickering. So I just leave them on the low setting and I can turn them on and off with a wall switch. My kitchen is not done yet but the pictures show the undercabinet view as well as the low level brightness in a dark room. They are exactly what I wanted but could not find in stores.,Perfect narrow easy lighting.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
9 people found this helpful,Mary Bonser,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2019","This light is awesome. Two light settings are a great option. I will use mine on the low setting most of the time. It fit great under the counter, and the cord is the perfect length. I also love the flat plug. I looked at a lot of different under the counter lights before I purchased this one, and I glad I waited. This is exactly what I was looking for. Great quality, and a great value",Perfect!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
5 people found this helpful,makesmiles,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2020","I used these lights as undercabinet lighting in my kitchen. The brightness is not very bright (on the brightest setting),but if you have a light colored countertop and a light colored backsplash the lighting is good. If your countertops and backsplash are a little on the dark side they will be too dim and two yellow. The flat plug is a big plus. I like them because my countertops are a light color and the lights give off enough light. The switch is a little difficult to turn on. They could have put a better quality off/on switch. I like the different lengths. I purchased (3) 36” Long and (1) 12” Long. They fit my cabinets perfectly.",Good lights for light colored countertop and backsplash.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
3 people found this helpful,Z. J. Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2020","I really like these lights. They were easy to install with the two provided screws. I connected two of them together with the accompanying connection cord and it worked like it should. The one thing I was disappointed about is that the connected light was not operated by the one switch on the light plugged into the wall. That may be a good thing for some, but it was a drawback for me. Also, the switches on the lights are small and very cheap. I am afraid that they will not last and they are hard to operate. I plan to put a sturdy switch on the power cord, so I can operate both lights with one switch and I will not put a lot of wear on the switches on the lights. There is also two settings on the lights, low and high. I really like that feature because it gives you a lot of lighting options. I would recommend these lights and I will probably buy them again. They are reasonably priced. They put out a lot of light. They are connectable. They have two light setting. They are easy to install. You might just want to plan on putting another switch into the light.",GREAT LIGHT. SWITCH IS SMALL AND FLIMSY AND HARD TO OPERATE.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
2 people found this helpful,April,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2020","This is a fine light for the money but I wound up returning it. As other reviewers have stated, the color of the light is very yellow. Even knowing that yellow light is much better for your health I could not bring myself to like the color of the light for the kitchen. I bought this light for lighting above our cabinets in our log cabin kitchen. We have a double window over the kitchen sink but it is underneath a covered porch and this makes the kitchen dark at all times. Lighting becomes a real issue in a kitchen like ours. So years ago we installed florescent lights above and below our kitchen cabinets. When the bulbs to these lights started to fail, we had a lot of trouble finding replacements. It's time to update our cabinet lights. I wound up buying a light that gives off more light at 5,000K which is more of a white light than yellow. I can see what I am doing better without the light changing the colors of the food I am preparing. At night, when whiter light can create sleep issues, I just wear blue blocking glasses instead. Honeywell does make a more expensive light in this style that enables you to change the temperature of the light. Had I bought that one, I probably would have kept it. Ultimately, I chose to buy a different brand because of price. One thing I did really like about this light is it is very slim which is great for under cabinet lighting in the kitchen. So if you prefer a yellow light and need something slim for your application, this light could work for you. It just didn't work for me.",Returned,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
4 people found this helpful,growworm,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","I bought this to install on top of a recently purchased kitchen pantry cabinet. The area seemed dark once the cabinet was put in place. This light on top of the cabinet adds an up lit glow to the area. Especially nice is the option of selectable brightness, either high or low. I keep it on low, have it plugged into a timer and have it come on just before dusk and shut off at midnight. Beyond providing light to the area it also improves the ambiance. I like it.",Well made and as advertised,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
One person found this helpful,Henry Wolford,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020","I like the color range of this light over others. This one is 2700K which is a warmer and softer than the others at 3000K. This unit is a bit thinner in width, but more importantly it projects upward less than others. This makes it much easier to hide under shelf lips or cabinet frames. This one is less than half the price of similar units, has the same features, and seems to be as durable. The most important thing for me was this one CLEARLY lets you know they can be plugged directly into 120 volts, while other units seem to imply to MUST also by a ""conversion"" unit to hard witre it into 120 volts.",Very good light at a great price,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
3 people found this helpful,Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2020","This is a nice fixture for the price. I also ordered the junction box since it is direct wired. It puts out a nice light, and is 2700 K temperature. My only quibble is that the small screws included aren't much good. Too short, and not suitable for drywall at all.","Nice Fixture, Supply Your Own Mounting Hardware",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
3 people found this helpful,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2019","I installed these under cabinets and wanted two of them to be about 2' apart. No can do--no linking cables available other than the short ones that ship with unit. If vendors tell you the GE cables will link these, don't believe them. I ordered and they did not fit, different design entirely.If your installation keeps all units close together this is a good choice, if you have to space them more than a foot or so apart, you won't be able to link them because the cables are nowhere to be found online.","Can't find linking cords of different lengths, seem to be not available for this design",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

4 people found this helpful,R. Hamilton,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021","I liked that this assembly is easy to install, is well designed and is compatible with a family of products. For my install, I replaced 3 fluorescent lights with LED lights as a direct wire install. In my case, I used the compatible UltraPro junction boxes for a clean install. Other reviewers noticed that the produced light is a bit yellow. In my case, the kitchen is in warmer colors so the light temperature is not a problem. I can see where a white kitchen the lighting would be too yellow. I would like to see the manufacturer build this same assembly with switchable light temps or individual temps. My installation went very smoothly. Inside the LED light box is a 90 degree/flat plug, a 2 wire link extension, 2 screws and of course the light assembly. Well satisfied with my purchase.",Great LED Light Assembly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

One person found this helpful,White Bear,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2020","These are nice under cabinet lights. Very light and slim which makes them easy to install, linkable w/included cable and pretty bright. I have 2- 36"" and 2- 18"" and they work great, my wife loves them. A couple tips: I read one guy suggest if you need to extend the linking wire just splice in 16/2 lamp cord ( same as what is there) using crimp connectors and you're all set. Also I have 3 units linked together at the plug end I'm using an in-line switch from Lowes.
