"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2018",795 people found this helpful,"I bought one at Gamestop and the left joystick stopped working after a few months. I sent it back to Nintendo under warranty thinking it was a fluke and bought another one while it was being repaired. The first one came back and worked fine but then after a few more months both failed, out of warranty. The problem seems to be the ball cover of the joystick top rubs against the round opening of the case and creates all sorts of plastic dust that gets into the joystick electronic switches and causes them to fail. I opened up the case, blew out the electronics and it worked for a little bit but then the problem came back, even though I kept the joystick top clean. I tried isopropyl alcohol to flush it, vacuumed it out and it worked afterwards for a week of heavy use but then failed again. I was quoted $25 or $29 to repair. But instead I bought a third party one and it has worked longer than the other two and continues to work. Until they fix this design flaw don't throw your money away.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017",267 people found this helpful,"I purchased this when I ordered Super Mario Odyssey because my original Grey Joy-cons suffer from the notorious connection interference. This controller is absolutely amazing! It charges over the included USB-C cable that can be connected to one of the two front facing USB ports on the switch dock or any other USB that powers the device according to the specifications. It stays charged for a really long time especially compared to the PS4 controllers. I haven't quite expereienced the claimed ""40 hour lifespan"" that is advertised on the box but it is well over 30+ hours. If you prefer a traditional gamepad as opposed to the joycons I couldn't recommend this enough. It supports amiibo and features motion controls that can still be used in a range of games.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018",201 people found this helpful,"I bought this thing because the joycons that came with my console started having issues that recalibrating was not fixing. I was so used to playing with joycons after a year of only using them. They were very comfortable as a controller in their own right, with or without the shell. I still want to get the joycons repaired or replaced someday when I get more multiplayer games/It took me a day to acclimate to the new controller, but it already feels just as, if not more comfortable than the joycons in the joycon shell. It's heavier but not uncomfortably so, it's comfortable to grip for a few hours of gameplay. Most of the buttons have decent feedback. The battery seems to be almost as good as the joycons were, I got mine last week and still haven't had to charge it since the first day.If I had any complaints, it's that the home menu and snapshot buttons are in an awkward location and don't have any good feedback, as they don't protrude out at all. I used to be able to take a video recording in the middle of a Splatoon game without getting pulled out of the action, but now it feels like I have to stop the action to reach the button.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'd recommend this over buying more joycons or replacing existing joycons,Ryan

A gamer friend chided me, telling me I'd eventually get the Pro Controller.I got a Mayflash NS adapter and tried syncing my XBox One controller and Wii U Pro Controller to the Switch. It worked, but the controllers either suffered from large analog stick deadzones, and/or incorrect neutral point settings on the analog sticks. In frustration I shelved the adapter and just used the Switch's side controllers with the included controller bracket.I have large hands so the Switch's side controllers were awkward to use. After about a week, I caved in and got this Pro Controller.As the same friend said: ""Nintendo sure knows how to make a good controller"". The fit, finish, and battery life of this controller is AWESOME. I've been binge playing Payday 2 with said friend plus another friend and even during long weekend gaming sessions, my hands aren't sore or cramped thanks to this controller's ergonomics.So is the price of this controller justifiable? In my case.... It was. But I gritted my teeth as I placed the order here on Amazon. As I've said in the past, Nintendo sure knows how to get me to open my wallet.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017",92 people found this helpful,"I figured I'd be happy with the stock Joy Con controllers in the handle. My hands are smaller than most gamers, so it was relatively comfortable for me to use them, until I tried to play Mario Kart with my brother with the individual Joy Cons... Even my smaller hands aren't tiny enough to work them comfortably, and they aren't evenly matched since the buttons are sort of off kilter as a pair.I needed a second controller if I wanted to play properly with someone else. Enter this beauty! The Pro Controller instantly has a great feel right out of the box, with a nice sure weight that comes from its rumble pack and internal battery. It works great if you have problems using the smaller Joy Con controller in its handle accessory. The controller charges relatively quick, and pairing is easy with the console once you've plugged the charge cable into the Switch base at least once.My only beef with it is unless you have a special case that has room for a pro controller, its a pain in the butt to transport/travel with. Anything that touches any button or joy stick will activate it and kill the battery in it. I don't plan on traveling with it much, so for a home controller, it works perfect!

"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018",35 people found this helpful,"I bought my Switch last year for Christmas for me from my husband ♥️. I love playing the Zelda games.The Joy controls took a little getting used to. I don't hate them but I don't love them either. I definitely did not want a corded controller, so the Pro A or Horipad wasn't an option (I think that is what they are called) so I just got used to the Joy con controls. My husband has really big hands so he really has a difficult time playing with the Joy Cons. He doesn't play the Switch that often so it wasn't a big deal. I didn't realize the Pro Controller had come out until recently but I didn't really want to spend the money at the time. However, I just saw that it was on sale after I bought ""Let's go Eevee"" so I hit the buy it now button and I am really glad I did!!!! The controller is set just like a pair of Joy Cons so no trying to remember a new pattern. It fits very comfortable in my hands and my husband's hands. Similar in design as the Xbox and PlayStation controls (see photos for comparison) It has a more rounded feel opposed to the Joy Cons. It feels durable and the battery lasts...I played for two days, all day, while my foot was in a cast and it didn't die on me.So far I have played with it on BOTW, Mario Cart 8 and Fortnite. It is not compatible with Let's go Eevee, but there is the Pokeball plus for that.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2018",34 people found this helpful,"I have been a Nintendo Switch owner for almost a year, and while I love the joy-con controller and grip overall, sometimes I prefer a more reliable and ""traditional"" controller. I finally picked this controller up on amazon this week. I love it. This is one of the most comfortable controllers I have ever used, which increases the enjoyment of my Switch games even more. The battery life is good, the layout makes sense, and it has built in motion-sensors for gyro-scope aiming, which comes in handy for games like ""Splatoon 2"" and ""Zelda: Breath of the Wild."" The only major downside to this controller is that the button layout for the ""pause"" and ""home"" buttons took a while to get used to, partially since the color scheme can make the buttons look similar. Other than that, I have no real issues with this controller; the battery life is good, and the controller itself is very comfortable, maybe matching the Gamecube controller as my favorite Nintendo controller. I would recommend picking this controller up for your switch. I spent months playing hours of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but worried about the stability of the controller I was using to some extent. Now I can comfortably sit back and play Breath of the Wild for even more hours on end with a controller that feels great! The controller is a little pricey, but more than worth it.

Pairing was a cinch and the battery last a long time on one charge.THE BAD: Only bad things I can say about the Pro controller is #1, its expensive! #2, that it's hard to go from the pro back to the joy-cons because the pro feels SO good in your hand. But maybe that's more of a bad for the joy-cons and not the pro, haha.OVERALL: If you are a gamer, you will love the pro controller.

Know that if you buy a Pro Controller, chances are, you WILL have problems down the line. It's such a bummer that this is a common issue among Switch owners. I take great care of my things, and my Pro controller has 2 significant problems after about 6 months of use.1) Left stick issues. When pushing the left stick upwards, the controller experiences what I've been calling ""reverse drift"" -- it pulls the input down. I've calibrated dozens of times, and this fixes the issue momentarily, but it always comes back.2) R-button issues. The R button's input works OK, but only if you push the button down with a bit more force. If you're playing a game that requires holding down the R button (like checking the map on Hollow Knight for example), the button will lose input unless you're really pushing down.This is my 3rd Switch controller to give me issues. I have 2 sets of Joycons that experience joystick problems as well. I love my Switch and am super bummed by their controller issues.It's worth noting that this controller is pretty expensive for the issues it experiences. I've had multiple DualShock 4s for years, with much more playtime on them, with no issues. Same with Gamecube controllers -- some of which I've had since the early 2000s.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2018",14 people found this helpful,"Where to begin...I've always been fine with the Joycons, Handheld mode, in the grip, or one in each hand. I don't mind any of those control methods, nor do I find their D-Pad buttons to be a problem. But I bought this controller for Smash Ultimate and to see what all the fuss was about, because I don't want my Joycons breaking in a moment of carelessness.I thought the Joycons were solid enough for the most part, but this thing, you could practically crack chestnuts with it. From the minute I opened the box and took it in hand, I thought ""this isn't the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but this thing is sturdy!""I charged it up right out of the box, played a bit with the wired connection (haven't had any lag problems at all in Wizard of Legend with it) and it finished charging from the Switch dock in a couple hours. Over the next month, I played with it every day when my Switch was docked (I just stopped taking hte Joycons off the main unit when docking it since getting this). It took, with about an hour or more of play per day, maybe a month before I got a ""low battery"" warning from this controller.Analog sticks are definitely taller, and face buttons are definitely bigger than the Joycons. That felt a bit odd at first, but I can switch between this and the Joycons/handheld mode for any game I own without trouble. The only difference I had to get used to is the placement of the + and - buttons; rather than being above each thumb as on the Joycons, they're between my hand here.I've had no troubles with the D-Pad, and find I rather enjoy it. Got this thing back in April, and have had no troubles at all with either analog stick or the D-Pad. (Which registers up, down, left, right, or diagonals only if I press them- no false positives at all from my Pro Controller.)Reads Amiibo just fine, I place them in the center of the controller to scan them in after I remember the right thumbstick does nothing .This is an entirely optional purchase for me, especially as I've always been more of a handheld gaming man, and am perfectly fine with the Switch's provided controller setup. But the Pro Controller is the best-feeling thing I've held that I can recall, as far as gaming goes. (Note: I've owned Game Boys, DSes, the Gamecube and Wii, and the Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2 for my PC, and that's basically it besides the 8bitdo NES30 Pro.)I have no fears of anything ever breaking this Nintendium-forged artifact, and it still looks as new as it did out of the package down to minute details. Also, the battery is massively overkill- I love it.If you think you'd like one of these, and are okay with whatever the asking price is at the moment, go right ahead. You can use it with Windows and Android phones or tablets as well, so if this controller lasts as long as my old Logitech has, $70 should average out to maybe pennies per month, especially since it works with a bunch of different machines.

HD rumble and motion controls work fine and battery life is worlds ahead of the PS4 controller. The D-pad is a step down from typically Nintendo design though, having no ball underneath the center, so every direction can be pushed in at once, which can occasionally cause problems, but I've played a ton of Tetris and shovel Knight with it and it's still pretty solid. The erganomics are stellar though, to be sure. Feels better than any other controller that I can think of and I think the Xbox one S controller is pretty top notch comfort-wise. Also, with the right Bluetooth controller adapter it can be used on the PS3 and aside from the six axis crap not being present it works perfectly.

It's very similar to the Xbox One controller, but the grips are a little bit thinner and I'm just able to get a more solid grip than the Xbox One controller.After months of use, it still works and feels like new. The construction is solid and there's no flex in the plastic when you grip it tight during intense moments. I've gone through probably 3 Xbox one controllers because the plastic starts to squeak after a few months of use and the buttons become unresponsive. So Kudos to Nintendo for continuing to make quality controllers.The NFC tag works nicely for scanning amiibos if that's your thing.One warning, and this may have been fixed with a controller update, but after not using one of the controllers for a few months, the battery drained and would only worked while plugged in. Even with charging for a few hours, it wouldn't charge. I decided to just leave it charging for a few days (using the provided Nintendo USB C to A charger plugged into the switch) and it worked again.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2020",6 people found this helpful,"UPDATE MAY 2020: Not that badSo after I wrote my initial review, I was able to get the stripped screw off (and destroyed the grip in the process, having to order replacements from ebay). Then over the ensuing months I tore apart the controller probably 20 times, trying different variations of the tape trick to fix the D-pad with varied success. The tape did largely correct the false inputs, but at the cost of sometimes not registering button presses. In the end, I decided to take off all the tape and use it as it was originally designed to be used, and guess what? It isn't all that bad. Sure, when you do the input test in Switch settings it registers LOTS of false inputs, but this is less noticeable during actual game play. Now granted, I'm not a professional gamer, but I used the D-pad extensively to play Rayman Legends and Super Mario Maker, and it worked just fine. So in conclusion, yes, the D-pad is far from perfect, it's a major blemish in an otherwise perfect controller and a disgrace for Nintendo, but NO, it is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It's probably still the best Switch controller out there at the time of writing. My advice is to buy it and spend some time actually using it before buying into all the negative hype and trying to mess with it. It really isn't all that bad. (with regards to my original review, everything I had said about the design and ergonomics still holds true, even with the aftermarket replacement grips I had to install).------Original review:First off, this controller looks and feels amazing. It's probably the most ergonomic controller I've ever held, and *almost* everything about it feels extremely well-built. But I say ""almost,"" because there's one major inexcusable flaw that just ruins it for me, and that's the D-pad. If you do a quick search, you'll see that this has been an issue with Pro Controllers since the very first model. The D-pad is way too squishy, and registers incorrect inputs when you move between directions quickly. It just blows my mind, how Nintendo, the company that INVENTED the D-pad can get away with making such a poorly designed sub-par one and putting it inside their Pro controller. There IS a fix, but it requires opening the controller and putting tape on the chip. I attempted it, but ended up stripping one of the screws and now it'll be impossible to ever open it up. So I'm stuck with a $70 ""premium"" controller with a D-pad that's so imprecise that it's borderline unusable. If playing games with a D-pad is at all important to you, save yourself the headache and frustration and buy a PS4 controller and an 8bitdo or Mayflash receiver. I used to always prefer official accessories going all the way back to the NES, but sadly, this whole experience has made me lose faith in Nintendo.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Update: not that bad.,F.

Once I found that and turned it off the issue was gone.Please ignore my negative comment below.I bought this controller in January 2020 and up until the last week or so (August 2020) it was working great and I absolutely loved it. I was totally fine with paying what I did and would’ve happily done so again.Unfortunately around last week my controller started having an issue where the left analog stick was drifting the the left and nothing could fix it. I tried recalibrating the stick in the Nintendo Switch settings and it would fix it for about 30 seconds before it started drifting again.This issue is particularly noticeable in games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe where my racer will start drifting to the left which makes racing almost impossible since I can’t control my own car drifting while racing.Sadly my warranty expired and I’m really annoyed that I paid so much only for it to break in less than a year. I take good care of it and always wash my hands before playing so it’s not an issue of poor treatment of the controller.I hope other people don’t have this issue but felt I should mention it since it happened to me.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great for the first year..then drifting issues.,Blake 
"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2019",5 people found this helpful,"...the Directional Pad is *very* subpar. If you're only going to use it for accessing features or items like in Super Mario Odyssey or Breath of the Wild, it works just fine. However if you're going to use it for retro or 2D games it leaves much to be desired. There's no central pivot point like in most every good D-Pad allowing you to hit Up, Down, Left, and Right at the same time and they are sensitive so you will be hitting directions you don't mean to. There's ways to modify it and there's tutorials all over YouTube, but you will have to disassemble the whole thing to do it. I have yet to do it but people have said it makes it a lot better.That said everything about this controller is fantastic. It's not a nice weight, feels quality. It is by far the most comfortable controller I've ever held. It lasts seemingly forever. It says 40 hours but I've yet to put a dent in the battery icon even after extended play. Motion controls are flawless and precise. If it wasn't for the D-Pad I'd say this is the best controller ever made. I don't know why Nintendo dropped the ball on that considering they are the ones who perfected them.If you're looking for something for classic or 2D games line the Online NES games, Sonic Mania, or Mario Maker this might not be fore you but all of your 3D titles couldn't be played on a better controller. If you want something for 2D games, there's some for sale here on Amazon that look like SNES controllers but with analog sticks (ones without sticks are also available) with an amazing D-Pad. Not sure if I'm allowed to mention them by name in reviews but they're not hard to find if you search for Nintendo Switch controlers.Update:After using this on Super Mario Maker 2 the D Pad works a lot better out of the box than I expected. Though not perfect it's fine for casual play but I'm sure people who do kizo levels might find problems. I've been using this with few problems. Occasional accidental diagonal presses but not nearly as frequent as what I saw when first trying out some of NES games. Might need it to be broken in a little.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2019",4 people found this helpful,"Unfortunately the left joystick started drifting down after about 6 months. I'm not a pro smash player or anything, so it seems hard to fathom that I used it more intensely than most during that time. I also kept it really clean, regularly wiping off the residue that easily accumulates on this controller while in use with a soft, dry towel.The other sad part is that Nintendo isn't taking de-facto responsibility for this issue. After I contacted them, they informed me that Pro Controllers purchased outside of the console are only under warranty for 3 months. After I insisted that I would not pay any amount of money for a controller they call ""Pro"" that malfunctioned in 6 months and pointing out the similarities with the class-action joy-con suit, the rep put me on hold to see what he could do.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2021",One person found this helpful,"So I've had this Pro controller for a month now and felt I'd been hands on long enough for a full review. Gotten about 150hours on Monster Hunter Generations and played a little Breath of the Wilds,I'm coming from 30+ years of gaming experience and have used every leading console developers (Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, Sony) 1st party controllers since NIntendo Entertainment System onwards to today. I've owned many, but have used all of them extensively at some point. I've been on PS4 extensively since lunch, easily putting 2k+ hours a year, and 3k hours on Monster Hunter World since launch. So PS4 controller is my most relevant comparison now so you know were im coming from.So firstly, I consider the Pro Controller to be a big improvement over the standard Switch Joy Cons. The Joy Cons ar3 just way to small, right Anolog stick in particular hurts my average sized hands after 30min of use, and button spacing isn't great. To be fare, there Controllers ment for a handheld and in that space they do there job reasonably well. So if you want a more traditional Controller for couch gameing, it's the Pro or a GameCube controller clone, and the Pro is probably a better choice assuming you need motion controls.The Switch Pro controller isn't terrible for sure. Size is fine, maybe slightly small, but decent for average man hands and probably great for smaller hands. But immediately I noticed the Anolog Sticks aren't great. The press function is too tight, Anolog placement feels off and need to be about 25% bigger. I've heard ALOT of stick drift issues, but a month isn't long enough for that to be a issue. Face buttons fell a little mushy, no click or feed back at all. And the face buttons are raised far too much, makeing simultaneously pressing two buttons inaccurate. The ZR/ZL triggers aren't variable at all, this could be particularly frustrating on a racing game, as it's either full or no throttle. I don't mind them not being variable since I play RPGs mostly, and they feel responsive. However the L/R shoulder buttons are awful! They drop inputs frequently and sometimes don't register promptly. Unfortunately many games use shoulder inputs frequently, Monster Hunter GU being a strong example of were this is a issue. It seems to be because the actual button press happens on the outer edges, meaning to get a responsive touch you need to hold them with fingers in claw like hold. This causes alot of finger fatigue on medium sized hands and surely far worse on large hands. 4 way D-Pad is fine, and probably better than PS4 controllers. I've also noticed the left grip moves slightly already, the grips are separate pieces and shift slightly. They don't feel like there breaking, but it's unnerving to have this in 30days. Finally my biggest gripe is there is absolutely no 3.5mm standard headset inputs on the controller, and I've been told USB-C inputs don't work either. So you still need to use the Switch 3.5mm input for a headset. This is 16years behind other console devs, and is completely unexeptable in the age of online gaming.3 stars I'd is very fare, it's not terrible and unfortunately is probably your only choice for a traditional Switch controller. But aside fantastic battery life and decent ergonomics, it well below what I've come to expect from Sony and Microsoft since lunch of Xbox360 in 2005.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Mediocre at best, unresponsive and flimsy at worst!",Susie's
"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"So we just got these the other day, so this isn't a review on their longevity. However, we absolutely love these controllers in comparison to the joy cons. These are SOOO much better.We've been playing Age of Calamity in 2 player mode, and it was a huge pain and no fun to do with the Joy cons. These controllers are worlds better. They are a little big compared to a PS4 controller, but a better shape than the combined joycons.They have a nice heft to them, and they're rechargeable. A lot of the 3rd party controllers for the Switch weren't rechargeable, and most, if not all, were not compatible with amiibos. If amiibos matter to you, it might be worth noting that the PowerA controllers and other 3rd party controllers probably aren't compatible.As for their charge, we charged them straight out of the box, played with them about every night for the past week and they still have a charge to them. I can't really quantify that in hours, but they definitely seem to last longer than our PS4 controllers (which are a couple years older to be fair).Last point of note is the button mapping. Trying to play Age of Calamity with 1 joycon per person, the buttons on each controller is limited, and the button mapping was confusing and aggravating. Having a controller or complete set of Joycons per person is really the best way to play, and it's definitely less aggravating. I'm not the best gamer, so when the button layout became too confusing with the joycons, I just ignored the confusing buttons (which in this particular game included the button to heal yourself).Last points of note is that they do come with their own charging cords, which plug right into the side of the Switch docking station for easy charging. They are a Type C cord, so most phone charges would probably work as well.

When mine arrived, I noticed it suffered from a condition labeled by the Switch community as ‘drift’, more commonly associated with the joycons. If you don’t know, what this means is my left joystick, at a neutral position, will slightly drift to the left without a physical input. This is kinda annoying, but now I’ve had mine for almost half a year, and it hasn’t bothered me much since. There’s no fix to this thats ‘user friendly’, since an at home way of fixing it requires disassembling the controller and messing around with the internal electronics.I’m ordering another one in time for xmas for my girlfriend, but know your controller may arrive with drift.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The best Switch controller currently available,Chris

"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019",One person found this helpful,"I purchased this to play Skyrim on the Switch, particularly in docked mode. Now, the Switch comes with a plastic holder that you can slot the half controls into to create a standalone controller for free. I'll call this the ""standard"" controller further down. So, why pay $60 or so for this?Well, in contrast to the standard Switch standalone controller, this has a very different feel to it. Because the controller is larger, the left-thumb control has a lot more ""play"" to it. This means there is more distance from the center to the ends. This gives me more precise control in-between the edges when using this than the standard Switch controller. And that can be crucial for some games. The standard Switch thumb control can only move a very short distance from center to end, making precise control between the edges much harder.Also, it has the vibration feature built in and a much longer battery life than the standard Switch controller. It pairs seamlessly with the Switch, and if you are using the Switch in a Docked mode, and have paired this controller, turning this controller on automatically turns on your Switch.If you find you play your Switch a lot in the docked mode, this is probably worth your money. If you mainly play your Switch in handheld mode, this isn't worth the extra cash.Also, if you do a lot of multi-player games such as Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, and feel like spending a lot of money, the Switch can pair with up to 4 of these at once.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great way to use Switch as a Console,C.

I was excited to get this controller that everyone has been praising for being ergonomic and having a long battery life. Here are the problems I found:- The thumb pads are not sticky enough so my thumbs kept sliding around and I had to put a lot of pressure to keep my thumbs on without sliding. This was tiring.- The controller is way too big. I had to uncomfortably wrap my hands around the controller and felt like I was stretching my thumbs to reach the thumb pads. (I have normal sized hands for a man whose 5’10”)- The thumb pads were too tall. This meant I had to stretch my thumbs even further.- The - and + buttons are further from the neutral thumb positions than on the joycons. Making reaching them take slightly longer.- The - and + are barely raised above the controller surface. So, they’re harder to find tactically. This is something I could probably get used to eventually.- The cherry on top for me was that L and R buttons sometimes don’t register when you push them past their “clicking” point. You have to press them just a hair harder for them to register. This meant when I was pressing them quickly in-game, that every few button presses were skipped. I don’t know if this a defect or what but. I don’t like buttons that click but don’t register instantly.So in short, the controller wasn’t ergonomic or comfortable for me.

One issue I have run into is when using it with any kind of emulator on the computer, the joy stick does not seem to be calibrated correctly. Using the OpenEmu emulator, during many games the character will not go into a full run forwards, and will go ridiculously fast if I pull back making them go in reverse. I do not notice this with the games on the consoles I’ve played on, so maybe they are able to adjust for the miscalibration while the computer programs just can’t seem to calibrate it totally correctly.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2019",One person found this helpful,"I have large hands, and I find that most controllers are smaller than I'd like (many are much smaller than I'd like). It's been years since I used a controller that I thought was large enough to sit well in my hands (Logitech used to make one that I really liked, but it's probably been at least 15 years since they stopped making it, and their more recent controllers are all much smaller). Historically, the Playstation controllers have been particularly bad. The PS4 controller is much better than previous generations, because they adjusted the shape to make it less cramped, but it's still too small. The XBox One controller is a much better size, but for me at least, it hurts my hands to use the RB and LB buttons because of how I have to twist my hands to press them (whereas with the PS4 controller, it's really easy to move my fingers between the R1/L1 and R2/L2 buttons). The Switch Pro Controller is not quite as large as I would like, but it sits far better in my hands then either of those controllers (or any 3rd party controller that I've tried in recent years), and while it's not quite as easy to move my fingers between R/L and ZR/ZL on the Switch Pro Controller as it is on the PS4 controller, it's close. So, for me at least, the Switch Pro Controller is far more comfortable than either the XBox One or PS4 controllers (or any 3rd party controller that I've found in recent years). So, from a comfort standpoint, this controller is a _huge_ win for me. No other controller is even close.I very much wish that the analog sticks were lined up like they are with the PS systems. Most of the controllers that I've used over the years have had the analog sticks on the same level, and I much prefer that to having them staggered like the XBox systems do and the Switch Pro Controller does. However, the comfort improvements with the shape and size of the controller vastly outweigh that problem for me.I have heard that the dpad on the Switch Pro Controller isn't that great, and some folks end up pressing up or down when they mean to press left or right (or vice versa), but that hasn't been a big problem for me, and there are videos on youtube which show you how to fix that problem. So, it's disappointing that they didn't make a better dpad, but it hasn't been enough of an issue for me to care.Ultimately, the Switch Pro Controller is so much better for me than any other controller currently on the market that I'm actually using it not only on my Switch, but I'm also using it on the PC, PS3, and PS4. I had to get adapters to get it to work on the PS3 and PS4, but it works, and for me at least, it's a huge improvement. If I had an Xbox of any kind, I'd get the appropriate adapter and be using it there too. Right now, the Switch Pro Controller is the only controller that I use.As an interesting bonus, the fact that the Switch Pro Controller has digital triggers actually makes playing games on systems whose official controllers have analog triggers more pleasant (even aside from the comfort improvements that come with the shape of the controller), because all of the games that I play either just treat them as buttons anyway or use them for something like the speed you run at, and I've never wanted to run at anything other than full speed, so having a simple button to press rather than having to push in an analog trigger and make sure that I press it in all the way is a really nice improvement. I'd probably feel differently if I played racing games (which apparently like to use the analog triggers for their throttle), but for the games that I do play, it's been great. And of course, if you only use the Switch Pro Controller on the Switch, then the way the triggers work is never a problem, because that's the way that all of the official Switch controllers are.So, from both a comfort and functionality standpoint, this controller is a huge win for me.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The best controller on the market right now,J.

It feels much more natural playing a game with a 'real' controller over the Joy-Cons with the grip attached. The only noticeable downside is that a few games don't support it at all, such as Super Mario Party and the Pokemon Let's Go games. Since I had exclusively been using the Joy-Cons from launch up until very recently, it took about a day to get used to the new sticks. They are stiffer to move, but are much more precise.

The included USB-C cable only brings in power and not data, so the only way to connect the controller to a PC is via bluetooth.Overall this is a great controller and I'm really happy with my purchase.

I pretty much thought that it was the perfect design for a controller.After I got the Pro Controller though, my opinions changed.The Pro Controller has a great ergonomic feel as well. The face of the controller is nice and large, and it has a matte finish to it. While the grip handles are a bit to small for my liking, the controls make up for it. The sticks feel has as good if not better than the Xbox controller's sticks, and I actually prefer the grip design of the Pro sticks. The Pro Controller face buttons are also miles better than the Xbox controller face buttons. While the Xbox buttons are only clicky, the Pro Controller buttons are nice and mushy, with a satisfying click at the end of the travel. The Pro Controller face buttons are also very large, which is something I didn't know I wanted.Other things that make the Pro better than the Xbox controller include: motion controls, heavier weight, and a better d-pad.That being said, the Pro Controller isn't perfect. While the aforementioned d-pad is better than the Xbox d-pad, it's still not great. The Pro is notorious for it's less than average d-pad. The size is a bit on the small side, and the d-pad is quite loose, which makes it prone to false inputs. Later revisions of the Pro Controller have improved on it though, and it's a least useable if nothing else.Overall though, I have to say that the Pro Controller has become my favorite controller to use. It's a shame that it really only works well on Nintendo Switch (it does have Bluetooth support for other devices, but you have to use external programs and the signal is prone to input lag), making it so that I can't use it on all devices.If you want the best controller experience on Switch, I think this controller definitely has to be on your final shortlist.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"My new favorite controller, so far!",Roberto H.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2019",One person found this helpful,"This is a really well built controller! I'll get right to the point about what I enjoy about this:* joysticks play really nicely, very smooth and accurate* Great grips! The controller feels like it melts into your hands. In contrast to just using the joycon (which don't have grips) , you can actually give this controller a death grip and still feel comfortable.* Not advertised, but it works well on the Steam client! (Nintendo doesn't endorse it) Valve developers have worked on drivers to make this controller work on all steam games.* Durability feels excellent. It feels like it will not break for another 10 - 15 years.* Dpad feels good, a great leg up from the Nintendo 3DS DPad. Due to greater thickness than any 3ds, the controller allows for a more bubbly feel when pressing down on the DPad. 99% of games I've played: Mutant Mudds, the NES Library, and Megaman 11 feel awesome. It will suit just about anything you throw at it.There is however one caveat to this controller, while the DPad is great, I wouldn't recommend it for something like Tetris where you require incredibly precise controls. For expert play, it's possible to accidentally harddrop a piece onto the board. I don't know many other games that require intense precision on all 4 corners of DPad, but be aware that the DPad can make the occasional mistake.I'm generally satisfied with this controller.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2018",4 people found this helpful,"Best controller for Switch that I’m aware of. That said, it’s flawed. D-pad is all one piece, and sometimes when you push Right the controller registers this as Up (which makes Tetris impossible since Up is the button for Hard Drop — results in constantly dropping pieces by accident). Seems like this would be the D-pad on a really crappy 3rd party knockoff controller — not the licensed (and irrefutably overpriced) one.I’ve been using the controller for 3 weeks. The left analog stick is already quite loose/worn out. I’m guessing it’ll fail within another 6 weeks.Otherwise it’s a great controller. The buttons are nice and feel high quality, and the overall feel of the controller in your hands is quite nice. If you can get past the fact that it’s expensive, yet destined to fail rather quickly (like almost everything these days), buy it.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,D-pad is terrible.

The triggers feel great and the entire controller sits right in your palms with all the buttons right at the ready for your thumbs. Only downside is the D-pad, it feels great but its not the most accurate, with no pivot point in the middle you can easily press more than one angle accidentally.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2017",7 people found this helpful,"+It's very comfortable to hold and feels substantial in your hands. I want to stress how solid this controller feels and the build quality behind it. I can twist the grips pretty aggressively and they don’t give or make noise. In comparison Sony and Microsoft’s controllers creak and feel like they’ll break from noticeably thinner and weaker plastic.+The analog sticks are very comfortable, have little friction, and the edges have a nice grippy pattern. After 2000 hours of Splatoon 2 the analog sticks return to neutral and there’s no wobbling or drifting. The sticks do rub against the sides though and will produce some plastic dust. One disappointing problem I ran into was occasionally the right stick would register a click despite not being pressed down.+It uses USB-C and comes with 1 Nintendo branded USB-A to USB-C cable about 5 feet in length. Plugging it in to your Switch will instantly sync the controller.+It lasts 40 hours. That's not impressive compared to the Wii U's Pro Controller at 80 hours, but it's still going to make it near impossible to run out of juice if you're addicted to Zelda. The controller feature gyroscopes, HD Rumble, and NFC which reduce battery life.+The area your fingers get into contact with are matte, and you won't have to worry about scratches, fingerprints, or other blemishes if you take care of it.+I clean my hands religiously, but on other controllers, oils would still build up and get into the cracks and it’s pretty disgusting. I’ve had only extremely minor oil build up on this controller. Maybe the plastic is coated in an oleophobic coating? It’s strange, but that’s possibly the most impressive thing I can say about this controller.+You can use the controller on a PC as a generic input device. It does not work over USB and requires Bluetooth.-The only part the controller that is glossy plastic is at the top of the controller which comes shipped covered in a plastic protective sheet. This also happens to be where the USB cable plugs in. It’s going to get scratched. It might look nice, but functionally this is foolish. Why would you make the only area where the metal could come into contact with controller the one spot that could get easily scratched?-The D-Pad registers false inputs when pressed. As of this review, Nintendo has refused to acknowledge this design defect. It makes playing Puyo-Puyo Tetris and Tetris 99 impossible since pressing Up makes pieces drop instantly.-The L and R bumpers have a very small area we’re pressing them won’t register an input well. If you use the outer edges you probably will never run into this but it’s still worth mentioning.-The Share and Home buttons are way too close and similar in shape to the + or - button, and there's no intuitive way to feel for which you're pressing. It’s too bad they aren’t + and - shaped like on the JoyCons.-The Switch has an option to use the controller wired for reduced input latency, but for most people this is rather useless unless you buy a much longer cord.-There's no analog triggers, but that's because it has parity with the JoyCons. Still not an excuse and would have made this item far more valuable if supported.-I had a harder time feeling HD Rumble on this than the JoyCons. It's a subtle effect, but given the size and rigid nature of this controller, it really should have been amped up overall.-It's $70 MSRP. That's not only more than a game, it's more than the competitors. I know controllers are more complicated than ever and its build quality is far superior with the exception of the D-Pad, but that doesn’t make it any easier to swallow.Children and smaller handed people can probably get by with Joy-cons. If you find them too small, this controller will be a welcome bit of comfort.I have personally gotten a lot of use and enjoyment out of it, especially with Splatoon 2. The only reason I’m giving it three stars is because I expect more responsibility and the highest quality from Nintendo products. One of the major reasons to invest in this controller is the D-Pad. Nintendo practically invented the modern D-Pad. That they’ve allowed this defect to exist and be denied is a travesty.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A must for large hands or enthusiasts,Amazon Customer

"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2020",5 people found this helpful, I received my controller just the other day. I was initially really happy with it. I played one cup in mario kart. Got first place in all the races. Then moved to a little super smash. Won those matches. Then settled in for some breath of the wild. While using the walking function for a great deal of distance I noticed a little cracking/grinding in the top position from the left stick. It did throw me off a little and I think something is wrong with the controller. Since I was walking I was moving it around in the top spot. I couldn't hear it. It was more of a feel. Its annoying. I only noticed it in botw because of walking so far. I quickly went to the store and tried to order another one. Out of the box the one at Walmart did it... It to had a little grind at the top. All of them seem to have this. Its hard to notice at first but once you feel it. I found a YouTube video of a guy showing a warn one and how his whole left stick on the controller does it. It was annoying in zelda. Apparently these controllers aren't the best. Its $60 in 2020...my N64 controllers still work. Whats the deal Nintendo? Its been about 15 years since I bought a Nintendo and so far the experience has been like alot of 2020. The switch is nice tho but the controllers are lacking.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Beware of the grind...,Josh
"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020",11 people found this helpful,"Ah, the Switch, what a console. It has tons of great games, both for casual and competitive players, tons of great multiplayer options, and lots of neat bells and whistles. Arguably its greatest feature is the ability to play it either docked to your TV or in hand held mode, and both feel great. If you're the type of player who keeps their Switched docked at all times, then this controller is a must!First off, the form factor. It feels solid, it won't be snapping in half. It feels like it can take a beating (though I make it a habit not to beat on my electronics) and the buttons feel good to press. I have big hands and this fits in them comfortably, no cramps for me. All the buttons are easy to reach, and feels good to hold, so good build quality all around. It hooks up easily (you'll probably need to charge it first) and once hooked up, it stays hooked up until I switch it to something else. I've never had a problem with it randomly disconnecting.The one problem I have had is that on rare occasions, the left stick gets stuck in the down position. When this happens, it is easy to pop back out and stops after a few minutes. IF this was a common problem, I'd have to dock a star, but because it only happens occasionally and not all the time, no stars lost.Overall, fantastic controller, and a must for serious switch players.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"Before you even consider buying one of these, Google ""Switch Pro Controller Left Joystick Drift"" (you won't need to type much since it's a top fill result...). I've now bought 2 of these, got them in, charged them and started playing with them and both had terrible left joystick drift down and to the left, enough to turn my character around and make me start walking that direction 25% of the time when I let go of the left joystick. These were both brand new. Googling the issue and hoping it was just a calibration thing or something, it's clear Nintendo used faulty equipment in the Pro controller, and it seems to be specifically bad on the left joystick. Now I get to return another one. These are $70, the most expensive game controller short of the Pro controllers on XB/PS, and there's absolutely nothing ""pro"" about them - no extra features, no modifiable button distances, and apparently no quality control. There are years and years of results about this, and things have only gotten worse since it seems they're shipping broken out of the box equipment now. Nintendo only puts a 90 day warranty on these, which clearly means they know they're garbage and don't stand behind their hardware at all. I'm extremely disappointed, and done with Nintendo brand accessories. If I'm going to get faulty trash, I may as well buy 3rd party for 1/3 of the money. By the way, after 3 months, Nintendo will charge you $50 to ""fix"" your faulty controller, and ship you back another faulty piece a month later. They've known they're faulty for years and continue using the same known-bad switches and sensors.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2020",One person found this helpful,"The controller feels fantastic in your hands. This is especially apparent after trying to use the tiny joycons with their even tinier buttons and joysticks. If your an adult with moderate to large hands you need this controller. Playing games like Resident Evil 5 or Doom feel worlds better with a controller that is designed for hands larger than a 10 year old's. Using the controller mount for the joycons is not a substitute for a pro controller. After using the pro controller, you realize that the joycon's tiny buttons, joysticks, and shoulder buttons are things you tolerate. Even if you decide against buying this controller (most likely due to the price), buy a cheaper third party traditional controller. Comfort - 10/10The buttons are large, which I love, reminding more of the larger buttons seen on the original SNES controller. The buttons along with the D-pad have a matte finish that feel great. A special mention of the D-pad must be made. This D-pad feels fantastic. Compared to the 8bitdo SN30 pro, it is NO CONTEST. The D-pad for Nintendo's pro controller is top of the line and blows the third party D-pads out of the water. The Joysticks feel good, maybe even great. They have raised edges with ridges for increased grip which feel good on your thumbs. I still prefer the concave shape of the Xbox One joysticks but the switch pro controller joysticks are comfortable, responsive, and accurate. Compared to the Wii U pro controller, the joysticks feel less sturdy though. The Wii U pro controller feel sturdy and require more effort to move them, which I like. This is not a big deal but I feel some may not like joysticks that have less resistance. Buttons and Joysticks - 9/10When it come to the value, the switch pro controller is a sea of grey. It really depends on the value you place on each individual feature found in the pro controller. The third party enhanced switch controllers are around 20$ cheaper and feel close to the same but lack many of the features the pro controller has (it doesn't even have basic rumble). You can also find even cheaper controllers that don't have even the most basic features of a pro controller but are still fine controllers if all your looking for is a comfortable gaming experience for your hands. I like the HD rumble and motion controls and would like to have the convenience of amiibo support (even though I don't really see it lasting much longer) so I don't mind paying the 70$. Nintendo's controllers are also known for lasting forever, so you most likely won't need to buy another one for the rest of your life (I still use the gamecube and Wii U pro controllers I got at the launches).

"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2017",3 people found this helpful,"The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is very well built, it's comfortable, has some weight to it and has textured grips to keep the controller from slipping out of your hands. There's no creaking or bending of the controller while playing, It's the alternative choice for those who want a more traditional way to play games compared to the Joy-Cons setup with the standard Attachment or Charging Grip. It comes with a USB-C cable and can be charged from the Switch docking station or AC adapter.It's an overall improvement over the Wii U Pro Controller, ditching the odd right joystick placement and moving it below the primary buttons, resembling a Xbox controller. It also has larger trigger buttons up top and larger X, A, Y, B buttons which are certainly welcome but it does still lack the pressure sensitive secondary analog triggers that both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers have - I personally like having that when it comes to racing games. The analog sticks feel smooth and rise slightly around their circumference to prevent your thumbs from slipping off. The classic D-pad makes a return again on the Pro-Controller, It's the same size as the d-pad on the Wii and Wii U Pro Controllers. It feels responsive and has the solid quality clicks you've come to expect from Nintendo controllers but I found that in a few instances, I've accidently click one direction when pressing another, thankfully it doesn't happen to me all the time but it could be improved. The + and - button placements are easier to use compared to the Joy-Con setup and are more in reach this time around compared to the Wii U Pro Controller but I wish the buttons would protrude outward more like the Wii U Pro Controller. While playing and without looking down at the controller, I find myself feeling around the for the + or - buttons because they sit almost flush with the controller face and it makes them somewhat difficult to press. The Screenshot and Home buttons also sit very flush and sometimes I'll accidently end up pressing them instead of the - and + buttons.The battery life is phenomenal, I can't remember the last time I plugged in the Pro Controller to charge it up. It can hold a charge for 40 hours and takes 4-5 hours to fully recharge. The Controller has the advertised ""HD Rumble"" that's been featured with the Joy-Con controllers. As far as I could tell—with the handful of games I've tried—the rumble feedback functions about the same as it does with the Joy-Cons. It also has Motion Sensors and built-in Amiibo functionality, you can place the Amiibo figure on top of the switch icon of the controller to scan it.It connects to the Switch via Bluetooth so you can easily use this controller on your home computers or smart phone as well. I've had some trouble getting it to connect on Windows 7 but then I tried Windows 10 and it was as simple as having your PC search for a BT device while holding the sync button on top of the controller for 3 seconds. Once the controller is properly synced, you can use it just like any other Bluetooth controller. Initially, I had some issues getting the Pro Controller to connect to my Switch but since then, it's been connecting every single time, one push of the Home Button and it takes 2 seconds.Just like the Joy-Cons, the bottom of the Pro Controller has four LEDs that represent which player it's set to(starting from the left) and if it's properly connected to the system. It is a pricey controller, at this point it cost $69 and that makes it a good $15-20 more expensive then it's competitors. It currently does not have a headphone/mic jack.Comfort wise, It could possibly be the most comfortable controller out there. Sometimes I even forget I'm still holding it when gaming for a while. If you own a Nintendo Switch and want a more traditional way to play your games that provides a proper d-pad, larger primary buttons, ergonomic shoulder buttons, extremely long battery life and is very comfortable to hold.. the Switch Pro Controller is certainly a step-up from your Joy-Cons.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,Amazon Customer

When it works, it's great...and then everyone encounters the same problems that Nintendo still hasn't fixed.First, especially for smash bros players, the snapback on the left joystick will make you go the opposite direction when you don't want to. Just a little flick, but it can really mess you up while you're playing. If you're familiar with the terms, this controller frequently will make me B reverse in the air when I don't want to. There are fixes for it, but it requires opening up the controller and soldering part of it. If you don't have the supplies to do that, congratulations, you get to pay EVEN MORE for this already overpriced controller.The second problem is one that more people get very frustrated with. After a while, the joysticks get scraped from grinding against the side of the socket that they're in. No problem right? Well it wouldn't be if it didn't produce plastic dust that gets into the controller. That dust will eventually make it so your joystick starts to drift while playing. For mine, it drifts downward. I've opened it and cleaned it multiple times and it keeps happening.I would stay away from this controller unless it goes on a HEAVY sale or they fix the issues with it.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Hey nintendo, are you going to fix the problems with this controller?",Margaret McDaniel
