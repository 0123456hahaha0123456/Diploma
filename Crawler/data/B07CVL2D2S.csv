"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2018","1,288 people found this helpful","This monitor is definitely a good value. Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Absolutely Amazing Value - Some other features not even listed!,Joshua Rhine
"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2018","1,092 people found this helpful","I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I'm guessing people didn't take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn't have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn't planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This monitor absolutely does tilt,Seth

"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2018",329 people found this helpful,"I very rarely write reviews, but am so disappointed with this monitor, that I felt the need to warn others. Originally bought this last year to use for school and work. After a few weeks, started having issues with it turning off and repeatedly blinking in mid-use, as well as dead pixels in the middle of the screen. Contacted Amazon, and they sent a replacement and I returned the original. Again, a few weeks of perfect operation. Then on the replacement unit, the power and menu buttons stopped working. The only way to turn on and off was to physically unplug the unit. Contacted Amazon again, and they referred me to the manufacturer. After several attempts, I finally got a hold of a person. They said they would look at, but I would have to ship it back on my own dime, and they would not replace it. I declined (mostly because I didn't have a box to pack it in, and was severely unimpressed with customer service).So I continued using it for several months with few issues. I stopped using it earlier this year, mostly because I got tired of the physical unplugging, and started using an old TV instead. Just now, went to fire it up again for my wife to use. After not touching or using it for the last few months, the screen is cracked in the middle, and as far as I'm concerned is unusable. And no, this is not a case of ""oops I dropped it and now I'm going to blame the hardware."" I have other Acer electronics, and have been for the most part satisfied, but this monitor has been nothing but problems.

No built in speaker, get a different model if that is what you want. Not for the novice, as the only usable instruction is ""turn off computer before installing"". There are 5 buttons on the bottom edge of the monitor, but pictograms are useless. But, don't worry; after you make all connections & power up the computer & monitor, the monitor checks connections & automatically picks the correct settings for you.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2018",123 people found this helpful," I’ll start this off by saying the screen looks great and the visual quality is top notch. However when I received the monitor it only worked for about 2 days. Then every time I turned it on it started restarting over and over every 2 seconds. So I contacted the manufacturer and they decided I should send it to their repair facility and I had to pay for the $80 shipping (wouldn’t have been that big of a deal if they had actually fixed it). About 2 weeks goes by and they returned the exact same monitor to me with a note saying they could not duplicate the issue and that they turn it on and off a bunch of times to make sure it worked properly. I knew exactly what was about to happen as I put it together and plugged it into the wall. Sure enough, it started cycling on and off immediately. Changed outlets, jiggled the power cord and unplugged and replugged them in and nothing changed. “Could not duplicate cust reported issue” pretty convinced they never even took it out of the box.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2015","1,137 people found this helpful","I bought two of these monitors a few weeks ago and they've been pretty great so far (aside from one issue which is described below).The best part in my opinion is the the thin bezel which is accurately depicted in the pictures above. In case anyone was wondering, the bezel (including the part of the screen that doesn't display any picture) is about 1/4"" (7/32"" to be precise).I was worried about the base not being stable when I bought the monitors, but the monitors are actually surprisingly stable.The main reason I'm writing this review is to warn people about the backlight bleeding that is present on both of the monitors I received. The pattern of the backlight bleeding is exactly the same on both of the monitors, which leads me to believe that I didn't just get unlucky. Under normal circumstances, the image quality is great. However, if there's a dark image on the screen and I'm in a dark room (when watching a movie for example), the backlight bleeding is very apparent on the two upper corners of the screens. This isn't a huge issue for me since I usually have a light on in the room, but I'm sure it might bother some people. This seems like a pretty common issue on budget IPS monitors, so I wouldn't rule this monitor out unless you find a monitor that you know for sure doesn't have this same issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great monitor, but has a flaw",Amazon Customer

"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2018",43 people found this helpful,"I purchased this monitor to replace a several years old, but nice Dell model. The build on this one feels light and cheap, but then it was 1/4th the cost of the previous monitor, and a monitor does not really have to put up with a lot of stress. I use it for work (browsing, reading, some graphics) and a little personal (video), but not gaming or anything intensive so cannot speak to that. What I did learn is that the input for video matters, a lot. Initially I connected the monitor using my current VGA cable (one reason I chose this particular monitor). The picture was fine, but I discovered that it did a poor job with any photo/video with dark tones. In a darker or shadowy picture, all detail was lost (the image looks almost black in some cases). This could not be remedied by adjusting contrast, etc. It was bad enough that I decided to shop around until I found an alternative monitor, at about double the cost. Just before initiating the return, on a whim, I changed the input to HDMI. I figured this was more about HD video quality, etc. But as soon as I made the switch, everything got better. Suddenly photos looked perfect, problem solved. This monitor does not come with an HDMI cable, so if you don't have one, I recommend purchasing one in addition. The only other thing that is worth knowing is that, as mentioned in the description, this monitor cannot be tilted. Because the base is round, propping it up is unstable. For me, its fine, I have it tilted up, and it sits on the desk.

I bought this to use with my Raspberry Pi, because it has an HDMI input. The input works fine and the raspberry has no issues with it. My only problem is, I got this to use next to my ham radio, and on 7mhz band it makes a little static on the band, not too bad. On 14mhz it makes a LOT of static. Almost to the point that I have to turn it off. On the 3.9mhz section it has several ""birdies"" that it produces - loud eeeeeeeeeee tones that switch off when the screen is off. The power cord is shielded so it has to be somehting inside the screen I cant shield.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019",14 people found this helpful,"First things first: please treat this review as a ""3.5 star"", which is what I would rate it if Amazon allowed me to.My main issue with this screen is that it has to be the sorriest excuse of an IPS/AHVA/PLS panel I've ever seen. The viewing angles are actually so bad for left/right that there is only a very small position where I can leave my head so that there is no discolouration on the sides, worse than any TN panel I've ever seen. Also, it looks like there is a lot of excess light directly off center to your head's position, as if there is backlight bleed that shifts as you move your head left and right while staring at the screen.Since this was purchased to be my second monitor, it isn't that big of a problem to ME specifically... but it also means it's impossible to keep my head in the perfect position, due to it being off-center to me. I actually had to tilt the screen somewhat sideways (instead of being flush next to my main monitor) so that the sides would mostly look normal in terms of colour.Now I WILL admit that it is possible this is a defect with my actual screen, possibly some problem with backlight bleed or something, but since this is my only sample size, I must rate it accordingly. If Acer has a problem with my statements, they should step up their quality control game and not let a monitor like this pass inspection for sale.Now, the good! For a breakdown, I've rated this a 4/5 for gaming, 3/5 for picture quality, and 5/5 for brightness, here's my take on each:- The input lag is quite low; there is no system lag while working on it. Being above 60Hz also gives it a solid edge for gamers. Gamers generally care less about viewing angle issues like what I described, so as a gaming screen this should not be too bad. Unfortunately I still cannot ignore the viewing angle problem due to how bad it is, and I will never rate any screen below 120Hz as 5 stars for gaming, so it settles at 4.- Picture quality is actually quite good. The contrast is great and the colours very crisp - if the viewing angles and backlight shenanigans were a non-issue i would probably even rate this 5 stars (largely considering the price), but alas, 3 stars.- For brightness, it's certainly bright enough for my needs, though I've not used it in direct sunlight. The anti-glare works well and it keeps its picture quality and visibility perfectly fine even with a flashlight shone at it. I cannot ask for more, so full marks here.All in all, for $90 I cannot truly complain. It does its job of being a screen for discord, watching videos/anime, and handling my stream alerts/notifications. It's light and easy to set up, the on/standby light is not bright yet still well visible, so not distracting in a dark room. Unfortunately viewing angle issue and discolouration it produces ALONE is enough for me to say consider other options, but the rest of the screen pulls it up a bit.If this is going to be your main monitor, and you are not someone who does little but game on your computer? Stay far away. If you need a cheap, decent screen for gaming or this is going to be a low-importance second monitor? I'd say it's up for consideration, if only because it's 75Hz at this price point.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Good for the price, but probably better options",D2ultima
"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2019",11 people found this helpful," I bet you didn't expect to see a review with this type of usage of the monitor, did you. I built a zombie containment unit for Halloween a few years ago in which it used a monitor to give the illusion a zombie was trapped inside the unit. I used a very cheap monitor in the past and found that it looked okay when looking straight on at it, but any angle from the sides or from the bottom would wash out the image and the illusion was broken. Given that the ""window"" was about 5 and a half feet from the ground, anyone shorter couldn't view the video.So, I found that I needed a type of monitor that had wide viewing angles so you can see it from off angles instead of just straight on. This monitor has an IPS board that allowed for these sharper viewing angles.Here are some things that I looked for when researching a monitor to buy:* Largest monitor I could buy for under $100 USD* Lightweight as it would be hung on the inside of the ""unit""* Bright/vivid video* Sharp viewing angles without loss of image quality* at least 22"" diagonal width. The previous monitor was only 15"" so I wanted to get a larger size for more realistic size ""zombiie"" within.This monitor checked off all the boxes. I also had a $15 Amazon gift card which softened the hit to the wallet.Once received, I hooked up the power cord and an HDMI cable that went to a small digital video player that had a memory card which played the trapped zombie clip. I didn't attach the base as doing so would not allow me to mount the monitor inside the cabinet. This isn't a Halloween prop build video so any details of the unit is limited to the monitor itself.I used a felt material inside the cabinet along the edges where the front of the monitor would be in contact with to protect the screen as this is a bezel-less screen on the top and sides. I didn't want any scratches! No bezels was the only real drawback to the monitor. Funny to think that as any other use would welcome no bezels.Anyway, the clip I uploaded is the monitor integrated within the cabinet. I'm really happy with how it turned out and having this monitor has really took this prop a notch up.Overall, I recommend this monitor if you are looking for a monitor with sharp viewing angles. Colors are good, no dead pixels on my screen and the price was right for the size. Other than how I use it, I can't say much more.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Used In My Zombie Containment Unit for Halloween,MegaByte

"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019",11 people found this helpful,"I bought two of these for a dual monitor setup. Unfortunately there are no instructions on installing the base of the monitor. The ""Quick Guide"" states that ""The monitor base is attached onto the monitor before shipment and it is undetachable."" This is clearly false as nothing is attached to the monitor. Rather, there are two pieces included: A round base and a middle bracket. Attaching the middle bracket to the round base was easy to figure out. However, attaching the middle bracket to the monitor was not easy. On the first monitor, we tried different things and none worked. We then thought the base is 'pressure mounted' so we tried to push it straight into the back of the monitor, and that broke two plastic tabs on the brand new monitor! On the second monitor we were more careful. After a few more tries, we discovered that you need to angel the middle bracket into the back of the monitor and then lift up for it to attach. If you do it right, it will work easily and quickly. If you find yourself forcing it in, then you are doing it wrong! Acer could make this easier for its clients by including installation instructions.Other than the above, it's a nice monitor. I have a VGA and HDMI outputs on my computer so I used the VGA to connect to one and a 6 ft HDMI cable for the other monitor: TIP: If you need to use the HDMI port like I did, order the HDMI cable with the monitor as it is NOT included. They might have included it in the past as some of the reviews says it is included, but it sure was not included with the two monitors I ordered in Jan of 2019.Also, it seems there are two versions of this monitor: one with speakers and one without.

I thought I could grab these Acers and update my workspace without breaking the bank, so I ordered 2 of them.They came quickly, which was good (they were actually available from Amazon Fresh for next day delivery). I installed one monitor and got it up and running, planning on doing the second one right after.

Playing with the settings didn't help correct the issue.I didn't even bother installing the second one. I started a return request with Amazon and then boxed up the open one and took both to my local Kohls for free shipping back to Amazon.So, apparently, monitors are on of those things that you probably shouldn't cheap out on if you have to stare at them for 8 to 10 hours a day.

I can now sit back further from my desk without straining my eyes while editing photos, reading, and watching videos. Since I'm not a hardcore gamer I can't speak to its performance in that regard, except to say that emulated DOOM ran perfectly smooth and looked great on it :-DMy only real gripe is that the buttons for power, display settings, etc are located under the bottom edge of the screen, which is really inconvenient, and there's no labeling or anything on the front edge to correspond to which button is which, so until you learn the layout by muscle memory, you might have to do like i did and keep the diagram from the manual as a cheat sheet. Once you get into the menus, however, there are plenty of options to tweak to your heart's content. I really like that there's a ""blue light"" setting for working at night or when you just want to give your eyes a break (obviously, you wouldn't want this on if you're editing photos, but for reading it's fantastic). There's also a display widget for certain models that you can download from the Acer website that gives you point-and-click desktop access to some of these adjustments without having to use the monitor buttons.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2019",5 people found this helpful,"I purchased this monitor for my wife to use with her Alienware R17X4 laptop. She had broken a key on her keyboard but also wanted a little larger screen. So, I purchased a wireless keyboard and this monitor. She now uses the powerful Alienware laptop as a desktop with a larger display and a wireless, movable keyboard. She is a very happy camper.Others have commented on the great graphics, thin design, and good quality build for a great price, so I won't repeat those details here. I will however point out a few tips:1. At first, it seems the stand will not tilt. But it does! Grasp the stand firmly and then tilt the monitor back to the desired position. Note it does not tilt forward or side to side, but does tilt back (facing more upwards towards your eyes) which really helps in most settings.2. If you don't get a signal, make sure you plugs the HDMI cable into the ""HDMI out"" port on your PC, not the ""HDMI in"" port. Duh. I had mine plugged into the wrong port until I found my reading glasses and saw the problem.3. We changed three settings which you may want to also do if you have a laptop. First, we changed the display settings to choose between ""Second screen only"", ""Duplicate"", or ""Extend"". We chose ""Extend"" so she can have two documents open at once on the two monitors, her laptop screen and the new monitor. You just drag one document off the edge of the monitor to move it to the other screen.4. Next, we found that closing the laptop, when she only needed one screen, put it into hibernation and shut everything down. We went into Control Panel and changed Power Settings under ""What happens when you close the lid"". We changed it from ""Hibernate"" to ""Do nothing"". Now the laptop keeps running even when the laptop is closed.5. Third, most Windows laptops are configured so you have to drag things off the right edge of your new remote monitor to get them onto the laptop screen. However we wanted her laptop setting to the left of her new monitor, so it was confusing to have to drag something off the right-hand edge of the monitor to get it onto the left-hand screen on the laptop. We went back into display settings, where you can drag the two monitors in the settings to reverse them. Now, she can drag items from the left-hand screen to the right-hand screen by dragging them in that direction, and vice versa. Much more intuitive to use that way.With those changes to the settings, she can open the laptop and use it as two monitors, dragging and dropping documents and apps from one screen to another. When she closes the laptop lid, it reverts to a single monitor (the new Acer) but does not go to sleep. This is perfect for what she needs. She can still power off the monitor when not needed for an extended period. Also, the laptop speakers still work when she turns on the sound even when the laptop is closed.I highly recommend this monitor for anyone wanting a very good quality, cost-effective solution.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great quality, fantastic price!",UrbanLegend

I dropped a LG monitor 22"" a few feet and because it has a bit stronger/thicker bezel, it survived. There is no way this would survive a small fall. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because ppl don't usually drop their monitors, but it's something to consider. Also, because the bezel is so thin, there is no room for VESA.. and this is where I would take a hard pass for this monitor. VESA is required for myself. Personally, I don't think anyone who wants any type of customization (with their setup) to purchase a monitor w/o VESA mounting.Overall I would recommend this monitor if it's at $90 and you if you do not need VESA mounting. Also it's important to note that it does not have audio pass-through, which is helpful if you wanna extract the audio from the HDMI and have no other ways of doing it.

Googled around, and couldn't find anything on the internet either. Then about an hour after it started, it stopped. Only thing I did was *lightly* slap the back of the monitor (mostly from frustration) and the issue disappeared. My wild guess is that it was caused by a poor internal connection. I'm worried that the issue will come back, but it's been another week and no issues so far. I'll update this review if anything changes. Of note is that the return window is now closed - hopefully Acer will honor the warranty if it happens again.Also, there's no VESA mounting holes on the back, which is just an unacceptable oversight IMO. It would be super cheap and easy to add them into the manufacturing process, and without them, I'm forced to blow 20 bucks on an adapter to be able to use a mount.

This did help with one monitor, but the monitor connected strictly with the HDMI cable just will not stay on/lit/connected.

It's very thin.No dead pixels (my last 1080p Acer had one stuck red pixel, this was ages ago though).I have hopes it will last longer than my last one because of the LED backlighting.Main complaint is ghosting or trailing when scrolling on websites with dark font and colors that aren't white. There's a site I visit more often than others, and when scrolling the text ghosts pretty bad, it's black text on a kind of blue/grey background and the ghosting is basically negative, as in it ghosts light almost white under the black text when scrolling. Hard to explain I suppose but even a literally ancient HP LCD monitor I have from Windows Vista era does not do this.Really griping I suppose and if you want consider this a five star review.

There is only a vga cable and power cord in the box.I bought this to use with my older mac mini (mid 2011) using a thunderbolt to vga adaptor that I already had. However I tested it right out of the box as a second display with my Acer windows laptop. My review is therefore for these two systems as shown:1) With Windows (Acer) laptop: I connected the vga cable to my acer laptop and it instantly recognized and duplicated the screen without a hitch. There is a bit of tilt to the monitor on the mount which allows it to be adjusted backward or forward (like an up or down neck motion). The colors of my desktop wallpaper appear true to the original and crisp, however words were blurry until I updated the drivers in Windows Device Manager and tweaked the resolution to be the same on both regular setting and 'active signal resolution.' ONE WORRISOME ISSUE came up: There is a horizontal flickering/flashing white line near the top of the monitor running two-thirds across the width. It did not affect the display because it was outside where the display frame would be but it made me think the monitor was internally damaged. UNTIL I connected to my Mac Mini...2) With Mac Mini mid-2011: Immediately after using the monitor for about two hours as a second Windows display to my Acer laptop, I disconnected from that system and connected the monitor to my Mac Mini 2011 model. Without any need for additional tweaking the display was immediately recognized, resolution and scaling were good, and my wallpaper slideshow is breathtaking. The colors are much more beautiful than the Windows system on the laptop, but I suspect this has more to do with the actual graphics card of the much older Mac Mini. Most notably however, is that the flickering and flashing white horizontal line is not showing on the Mac display. I have no idea what to make of this.

The temps inside get up to 88 F on a hot day with a 90 F high! As room temp is considered to be 68-72 F, I was worried about my high end Lenovo ThinkVision monitor ($300) and HP color laser printer ($400) being fried or corroded in the heat and humidity of this wretched climate. So I placed both in my air-conditioned self storage unit while I look for better living conditions.To replace them, I decided to buy this $85 Acer monitor and an $85 HP inkjet printer (which costs less than a black toner cartridge for my color laser) and I could pretty much dump then when I move abroad to live (my main intentions). While the Acer is no match for the color saturation, overall screen quality, and bells and whistles of the Lenovo (which was pretty much hand-picked at Best Buy before I pulled the trigger on a good monitor), the Acer has surprised me for such a cheap monitor. It's sharp and color contrast is excellent. My main issue was the screen background being yellowish-green compared to my Lenovo or my Dell XPS, however it got whiter with time as the monitor burned in. In addition, I used the preset screen settings and found a couple that was able to whiten up the screen quite a bit, so that now, it's not bad at all.For $85, I expected soft, blurry text with dull colors in which case I'd return the monitor but I have no complaints now: sharp, excellent color saturation and contrast, and decently white background. Just be aware it has ZERO USB ports, no USB charging port, no HDMI or DisplayPorts, and no audio out port - nor height and tilt adjustments - like my Lenovo. It's probably worth it to spend 3-4X the cost of the Acer to get this if you want to get a really good monitor. But for my purposes, the Acer suits me fine.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2021",One person found this helpful,"First the pluses: I've only had this one day, but it seems pretty good for general ""home office"" purposes. It's bright (had to turn contrast and brightness down quite a bit for comfort), text is clear and easily readable. Color looks reasonably good to me right out of the box, which is a good thing as I can't immediately see a way to fine-tune colors in ""Standard"" mode. There may be a touch more green than I would like in skin tones. I also really like that this monitor has both HDMI and DVI inputs. This was one of the few monitors I could find in this size & price range that still had a DVI connector, which I need with my older video card.As to minuses: My biggest concern, is that black and dark colors get washed out more than I expected, especially if my eye level level is near the top of the screen (or higher). If I elevate the monitor so my eye level is near the bottom of the screen, the contrast and black level improves a lot...but then I'm looking up at it. And the stand has no built-in height adjustment. Similarly, if my eye/head position is lined up with the left side of the screen, the black levels on the right side get washed out. So, it seems to me that this monitor, despite being IPS, is still quite sensitive to viewing angles/position. Not so much with bright colors fading out, but with the black levels rising to hazy gray.The control buttons are small and unlabeled (and on the bottom side of the bezel). It's easy to hit the wrong one when trying to make an adjustment or work through the menus. (It's ridiculous that manufacturers don't label or mark the controls, functionality should always take priority over style.)But, for a nearly 24"" screen at this price, maybe I ask too much. It seems like not that long ago, a 17-19"" CRT was considered a ""large"" monitor and typically would cost $300 USD or more.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Viewing angles/dark details washed out,Zathras

Looks great with room lights on or off.-Lightweight (only 6 lbs).-Best response time out of any IPS panel display I've seen (only 4 ms)-Very sturdy base.-High viewing angles.-3 different input ports makes this a dream for compatibility.-No backlight bleeding(a common problem with some displays)-No assembly, the monitor just slides on to the base and clicks in place. I set up 2 of these in less than 5 minutes.-Packaged very well.-Includes VGA cable, which I though I was going to have to purchase separately.-Cons-Not VESA mount compatible.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2021",3 people found this helpful,"I have purchased this monitor 4 times in the span of 2 years for myself, my sister and my dad. They were around the $90-93 price range. I gotta say, for the price, I am very satisfied with how well it's done for me. My family also has no complaints using this monitor with their own PC's. The bottom base of the monitor is super easy to install. No built-in speakers, but if you use external speakers and a headset like me, you don't even need/want them. As I mentioned in the title, these are not VESA-mountable so if you're looking to mount these monitors, look elsewhere.Some of my main games are League, Apex, Monster Hunter: World, Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy XV, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. This is a decent range of graphics intensive and non-graphics intensive games. I had zero issues with response times and frame rates. They all run smoothly with my GTX 1060 (as long as you play on medium-ish settings). Sure the colors aren't mind-blowing but I don't care at all. I personally think it kicks ass for the price.When it comes to non-gaming stuff, like school or work, there's not really much to ask for other than a monitor that can turn on and work, and this monitor is definitely capable of doing everyday tasks. The 75hz is also very nice.I don't use these monitors anymore as I have upgraded my setup, but I should mention that during the last few months of using these monitors (I had a dual monitor setup), one of the screens randomly goes black every now and then, then turns back on. It can get pretty annoying and can even cost you during crucial moments in-game.Other than that, this monitor was part of my first gaming PC build and I am still very happy for how much it has done for me. A very solid start, whether you're a gamer like me who can't afford an expensive monitor or if you simply need a cheap but good monitor that can get the job done.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"if you're a budget gamer like me and don't care for VESA mounting, this monitor is for you",Tyler Nguyen

Also, if you are looking to bump 2 of these together, even though it appears to be very minimal frame, there's still a good 3/8"" border on the top, left and right, so that would be a pretty noticeable gap.

I was on a tight budget, and with the quantity and quality of reviews this thing had, I figured it was a worthwhile purchase. Once the tower was built, I plugged in my computer (HDMI from the graphics card interface), and was greeted with the message ""input not supported"". After some research, I learned that I needed to update my display drivers to output HDMI, but, in order to do that, I'd need to get the machine running and install windows, and to do that I'd need to use a monitor. I could have used the Mini DP output on my graphics card, but I learned that the monitor didn't have a Mini DP input. Several hours later, with the help of another borrowed monitor, I was finally able to update the drivers and use this one. All that toil and trouble to see an adequate picture, at max brightness.In short, if you need a Mini DP port, don't use this monitor.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2019",One person found this helpful,"The attached picture shows the blurry text that only started happening after switching from my tv to this. I changed no settings other than making text bigger after switching from my tv to this so why are things so grainy and blurry with this ""number 1 ranked"" monitor? I only bought this monitor to help my eyes.. I have bad eyesight and as I age it's getting worse. Going from a 43 inch tv to a 21inch monitor is difficult but It's helped me enjoy streaming more since I still use my tv for streaming. It's helped me play LoL better because now I don't have to look two feet to the side anymore lol. I am disappointed with how hard it is to clean the screen. My tv screen is also hard but it never absorbed water(maybe my tv has a coating or something). I wish I would have known this screen absorbs things before I tried to clean it.. Made a permanent smudge(maybe its not permanent and I just don't know what cleaner I'm supposed to use on screens). I had old monitors that were SO easy to clean the screens(LCD flat panels..). Since I've been using this monitor and keeping my tablets blue light filter on I have not had a single eye strain related eye twitch. I just wish it were capable of being cleaned and that things weren't so GRAINY. The only reason why I'm not sending it back is because it's clearly helping my eyes not get as strained..... I would have given it less stars if I didn't care about my eyesight as much. I can confirm it has tilt but I couldn't figure out how to get the tilt to STAY tilted without re screwing those two screws back in(which made it not tilt anymore lol..) So I wedged a Popsicle stick in it to keep it SECURELY tilted. Luckily I can't see the eyesore when using the monitor even with it tilted back. I'm not sure why it takes 6 seconds for this monitor to turn on. My entire pc only takes 13 and its 8 years old(with a newer nvidia gpu that makes me want to go back to amd sometimes). I wish the power light didn't blink when in standby mode. I'd love to not turn this monitor off when I'm not using it because it goes to standby mode very quickly after my pc is off and only uses 0.05 watts more than being off and plugged into outlet but that blinking power light is too annoying.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Not sure how its ranked #1,John H

"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2015",One person found this helpful,"I'd say this is the best purchase you can make if you're on a low budget for an IPS monitor (meaning it's better for your eyes and not meant for gaming). It's bright and clear with no dead pixels. As someone has posted before a couple corners on the screen seem to glow a little when you have dark images on the monitor but are not noticeable if you have brighter images on the screen (not something that really bothers me whatsoever). I think this is happening because the screens aren't perfectly straight when you look over the top of the screen from the side (almost as if you're looking down a rod to see if it's straight). They are slightly warped but not enough to notice unless you're really looking for it... I think it's causing pinching in the corners and affecting the lighting. These are things you should expect if you're spending only $130 for some large IPS monitors so I have no complaints about these issues and overall the picture is great for the price.If you have more to spend, go for the BenQ IPS monitors... and if you're looking for a gaming monitor then this is not for you. You'll want a TN monitor for that with a faster refresh rate as IPS monitors usually don't have fast refresh rates (this one is only 60hz).I'll be sure to update if anything goes wrong with them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Best IPS monitor for a low budget,Michael903

Installed the base no problem, hooked it up, no problem and off and running. First thing I noticed is that it is much brighter and crisper than the LCD screen it replaced. I am not an expert on color reproduction and all that. It seemed fine right out of the box. I did some minor tweaking in my NVIDIA control panel to tone down the brightness by about 3% but other than that, nothing.I play an online multiplayer game and I immediately noticed how much smoother this was and everything looked almost new. My old LCD was still a pretty good 5ms monitor, but this one transitions so much better.Other notes:-Using a DVI-D connection to my computer - I have a lot of cables lying around and for me the included VGA cable goes into the electronics recycle bin-This monitor uses a power ""brick"" but it is so small, it's more like a power ""mouse""-The base is great, my old monitor used to shake when the washing machine went into spin cycle. This one doesn't move a bit.-For the money, if you are looking for a good monitor without a ton of features, just want to plop it on your desk and be done with it, this is a great deal.-This monitor appears to be exclusive to Amazon.-It's a very nice design, very pleasing to the eye.-I have this side-by-side with a very high quality HP display and I think the two are comparable.

When I gt it it assembled really quickly and was easy to use. The freesync worked perfectly and for the price I got to buy alot of other gaming hardware.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2016",52 people found this helpful," I would rate this monitor as a 2.5/10. I'll list the pros and cons then follow up with a more detailed explanation.Pros:-Clear and vivid screen-Good looking monitorCons:-Began flashing on and off when in use (6 months after purchase)-Acer makes you pay for shipping for repairs... even during warranty period-Buttons on monitor are too small and unmarkedInitially I needed a second screen for my laptop. After looking around for a while it seemed like nothing else really compared for this price point. I order the Acer R240HY. At first it was fantastic. When it works (note that phrase), it looks great... crisp and clear. However about 6 months after purchase it began to act strange. It flashes off and on randomly when trying to use it (see attached video). The screen going black every few seconds makes the monitor utterly useless So, I call up Acer support and this is what the support tech tells me ""unplug and re-plug it in... did that work?... no... ok, that's all the guidelines we have... you'll have to send it in for repair"" As it turns out you're responsible for the shipping... let me rephrase that ... YOU HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE YOUR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FIXED. Based on that alone (let alone the fact that it's a defective piece of equipment) I can't recommend this monitor.

The biggest being dead pixels. I've purchased two of these monitors for my dual monitor setup. And unfortunately, both of them have at least one dead pixel. On one monitor, it's near the center. And the other being on the top left.Past the dead pixels, if you use this for gaming and might use the built-in crosshair. Then the crosshair built into the monitor can unfortunately not be scaled and is absolutely massive.Besides that, it's overall a pretty decent cheap monitor.

No ghosting.- The non-glossy screen is exactly what I hoped for.- The power brick -- it's pretty small compared to some I've seen other screens come with.- Very lightweight. Easy to put together without any issues.CONS:- It is very wobbly and easy to tip simply by pressing the power button. That is the cost of having it be lightweight, I suppose.I can see it being knocked over very easily, so I do not recommend placing it anywhere too precarious. Definitely not near children or nosy pets unless it is weighted down solidly.- Man, it is BRIGHT. At times, this is really helpful for certain things.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2016",One person found this helpful,"I have three of these monitors in surround. I am a pretty serious gamer and I wanted these monitors for the thin bezels and anti glare screen. All was good when I got them and set them up. Man do they look nice! The stand is pretty high quality and the screen in very thin. On first boot they were bright and decently colorful. Not as good as my old one, but for the price not bad. I soon noticed that the color was not the same on all monitors. one of them had slightly less bright whites, and one had whites with a slight tint of yellow. This was mostly fixed with some adjusting in the settings. So far these issues are easy to look over since they look so nice and nothing beats having three identical monitors. However they are not that great for the one reason I bought them for: Gaming. These monitors have SERIOUS image ghosting. If you don't know what this is, its when the pixels leave a shadow behinds moving images on the screen because they cant change color fast enough. This adds very noticeable white and black shadows in every game even the desktop. Coming from a higher quality (now discontinued monitor) these do not perform very well in that regard. The pixels are very slow. Even textures with little contrast get blurred when moving forward.Now I am giving 4 stars because of the price/performance. They do what they said and look nice. But if you are a serious gamer that is used to a nice responsive image look for a lower latency panel.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Good looking but very bad image ghosting,Brian

"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2016",One person found this helpful,"Cons first: It says 1,000,000 to 1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio, which if you don't know by now, is a useless measurement, Dynamic Contrast Ratio refers to the screen mode that detects light and dark scenes in order to adjust the backlight to produce more ""contrast"". This feature is not even on by default, not that I would use it anyway. I suspect its true contrast ratio would be lower than the typical 1000:1, which is why it's omitted both here on Amazon and on the Acer website. Coming from glossy HP monitors, the colors just seem very washed out. Dark grays turn into medium grays, etc. That's partially due to its matte finish, but it's also partially due to it being a budget IPS display. I now have another professional matte display by Dell (U2515H) that has great contrast, comparable to my glossy HP displays (27xi). If you're going to buy an affordable IPS display, I would recommend going glossy, unless you are in a super high-glare environment. The new xw series by HP has semi-gloss displays, and in stores they look like they have decent colors while having relatively low glare. They may be worth checking out.The monitor also takes a long time to start up if you don't leave it on. It takes about 4 seconds. It shows an Acer logo and then an Energy Star logo before the picture comes through. Your computer wakes from sleep much faster than that.On the plus side, the 4ms refresh rate is pretty nice, and the bezel is about as thin as you can find (same as my new Dell). Besides the cons of picture quality, it works as you would expect, and although the circle stand isn't the most attractive option, it is made of a nice metal, and you can put snacks in the center.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Why they hide the contrast ratio from you,A.Z

"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2016",One person found this helpful,"Excellent value for money. I suspect this to be one of the best choices of monitors in the category. I am very satisfied with it's performance and have found no evidence of leaks around the perimeter (as a review I had read might have suggested). Picture image is absolutely steady and color and detail are vivid and sharp. The frame around the image is arguably the thinnest in its category. This is a big plus when it comes to long sessions of work. Also, it would be a plus when using multiple monitors. As I expected, there is a relatively wide viewing angle from any direction - so there is little need to adjust the stand constantly. Again, during long sessions of work I change my angle and height of viewing quite a bit, the wide viewing angle is much more comfortable in such cases. One small issue I have noticed while testing is that I would have preferred a height adjustment on the stand. My preferred viewing height would have been about an inch shorter than the fixed 4.5 inch height (bottom of image to desktop). Sometimes I have to place the monitor on a standard tabletop at work, which is particularly where this need becomes apparent. I thought of mentioning this only for the manufacturers, but it is not really a big problem since I am quite accustomed to it even at this time, three weeks after putting the monitor into use. Since I use this monitor with a new build, its generic drivers were installed by Windows during assembly. However, I replaced these with the Acer drivers. Regardless of how impressed I was with this monitor, I have to state that although I have been a computer builder and business user/enthusiast for many years, I have not been able to figure out how to use the physical buttons on the monitor to tweak its settings - I gave up and used the Windows Control Panel instead.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2017",One person found this helpful,"I bought this monitor because I foolishly purchased a gaming laptop with a screen that was too small. For $129, this monitor was a good purchase. It's thin enough to be unobtrusive in my living room, but increases the display area for my games enough that the gaming experience is greatly enhanced. I'm using the single HDMI output for connectivity, and the graphical detail is excellent. I haven't found the edge lighting to be as obtrusive as some reviewers have reported, perhaps because I don't play games in a very dark room, so that's a moot point for me.Setup was very simple and straight forward, taking less than five minutes from opening the box and assembling the components to having the monitor up and running. All you have to do is attach one bracket to the oval base and secure it to slots on the monitor. Completely painless and intuitive.Overall, I'm very happy with this monitor so far and would recomment it without hesitation.
