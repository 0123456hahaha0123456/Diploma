The threads, although aluminum, are good, and screw in the easiest from all my filters (B+W, Hoya and Tiffen). It does add a cool cast to images, though, and one that I'm not at all pleased with. It's correctable, but not easily so - it cuts different channels in different amounts, and it can be a PITA to adjust in post, especially for video. It also flares quite a bit, despite being coated.All in all, I prefer the cast of my B+W filter, which gives a warm tint (also difficult to correct, but much easier to live with).",Has a complex to remove blue cast,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
10 people found this helpful,Sir Carl Jr.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2016","Pros:- Long lasting: I have been using them in and off for the past 3 years and they are still going strong.- Flexibility: 77mm is the filter size of the widely used Canon 24-105L and most all of the other lenses save the 24-70L II are smaller, so you can use this with step up rings.- Color: They have not distorted colors nearly as bad as other cheap ND’s I have used have.Cons:- They cause vingetteing at 24mm because they are not the super thin ones, but that’s obvious so more annoyed at myself than these filters.Absolutely great quality. This filter feels sturdy and they are sturdy. Neutral density filters are filters that EVERY photographer should have in their bag! I have taken some amazing photos with it. I highly recommend this filter for those needing an ND.I also have many filter thread step ups so I have used it with multiple different Canon, Tamron and Tokina lenses on my Canon 5d and my Canon70d.",Very good build quality for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
7 people found this helpful,Carlgo,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2018","For those who wonder, even after hours of searching, whether a .9 ND filter is appropriate for a 1.2 lens, the answer is yes. 3 stops does it (that is from an aperture of 1.2 to 2.8, the point where the 1.2 can actually be used in bright daylight).A 1.2 simply cannot be used as intended during the day, wide open which is its purpose in life and why people buy such things. I found this out when my new 1.2 arrived and I excitedly went outside to test it...fail! Had to order this and wait a couple of days. Is just great and opens up some new image options for me.It arrived clean and seemingly well made.

However, I do a lot of portrait/beauty work and I found there is a significant, complex color shift. See image (left is without the filter, right is with the filter). I don't mind adjusting the white balance manually but I'd much prefer if there was no color shift at all. It is all coming from the filter.Furthermore, in Lightroom, correcting one color (grey) changes the color of a different hue (green).

Regardless, I've used this ND filter multiple times to do long exposure shots and seems to work pretty well. Depending on the light there is a bluish hue that can be fixed with photosoftware. There are threads in front so you can attach to ND filters together which is nice. Overall I'm happy with the quality and it works for me now.

One person found this helpful,JDT75,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2013","Purchased this for the main purpose of getting those silky smooth water shots. It will reduce the amount of light entering your lens but is not dark enough to get that really slow shutter speed under bright light conditions. Even with the ISO turned down to the slowest setting and the f-stop at the slowest (f-22 or so) you might not be able to get what you are looking for. When shooting under overcast sky or near dusk this works pretty well. If you are looking for really slow shutter, with the ability to control your depth of field I would suggest stacking more than one.Unless you are looking for graduated ND filters I would suggest this over the square slide ins as this doesn't allow light to reflect off the back side of the glass (or plastic in cheaper models).At this price I would suggest getting this along with at least one more of the same or a lower density to allow for more flexibility.Overall highly recommended for those wanting to get creative with their photography and do stuff you just can do in PS.",Dreamy waterscapes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

3 people found this helpful,M D,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2013","I actually purchased this not for taking waterfalls photographs, but because I wanted to get some really nice depth of field during the day while shooting video. I've been using my SONY NEX7 a lot lately for video, which by the way is a great great camera, I cant say good enough things about. But during the day I was at around f22 and wasn't able to get those super nice depth of field cinematic shots. This allowed me to bring my aperture down to around f5-7 which is great. I imagine if I wanted to get even more depth I could purchase a .6 or .3 and stack the lenses to get down to a 2.8 or so, but for now this thing does the trick. I did contemplate buying a variable ND filter, however in the past I've had weird zebra-ing effects, and crosses through the image.

You can certainly spend more on an ND filter, but I'm not certain that you would be gaining much.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent pocket friendly ND filter. I use it for my 24-85mm kit lens of Nikon D600 to get good smooth water surface.

I have only taken it out once and had no real issues and it performed as expected. I experienced NO excess color splash or blurred corners as some users of similar products experience.It did fine on my 24-105 lens and no issues with attaching it to etc.The key to using these filters is to compose your shot first by focusing without the filter then setting it to manual, then attaching the filter and shooting. But the reality is you can still see clearly enough with this filter as this I believe is 2-3 stops down so its not that crazy when it comes to the stop ratio if you are shooting a brightly lit area.Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and will probably seek out Tiffen for my filter needs.",This filter has worked out great for me,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

4 people found this helpful,Mike,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2012","This review is for the 37 mm filter.I've taken a few pictures of the same scenes with and without the filter to test it.* The filter does cut the amount of light by approximately a factor of 8, which is what it should as a ND 0.9 filter. If you need more, look for a different filter, but this works as advertised.* In images of the same scene, with auto-white balance on, I notice a *very slight* yellow cast. Gimp (freeware version of Photoshop) fixes it easily, and I'm sure I could fix it by fiddling with the camera's white balance.* The filter did come a little dusty, but with no damage.* My filter is held tightly in place, but a few reviews mention it being loose. If it is, you should be able to fix it by tightening the retaining ring.I also tested it with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The OD is about 0.9 for most of the visible range. It is 1 at 405 nm and drops to 0.8 at 682 nm. The OD increases sharply at shorter wavelengths and decreases sharply at longer wavelengths, which explains the (again, very slight) yellow cast.","Decent filter, great for the price",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
