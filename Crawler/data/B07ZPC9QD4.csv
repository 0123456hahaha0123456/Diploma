"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2019","6,757 people found this helpful","Like iphone 11 Pro, Macbook Pro, Airpad Pro; the ""Pro"" denotes a higher end product.Compared to the Airpods (version 2) highest end model (with wireless charging case*); the Airpods Pro is $50 more MSRP.Compared to the non wireless case version it's $90 more*Airpods Pro does have wireless charging case by default. Only one version.Let's go through the differences1. Physical Appearance:Shorter Stem, but larger bud or headThere's a large black airflow grillA mic inside and outside the AirpodsCase is same thickness, a lot wider, but shorter. Still uses lighting cable to charge, but it does come with a lighting to USB-C cable2. In-ear, instead of on-earIf your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place.Those with normal or larger cavum it'll fit well.Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canalThese ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open oneSeeing that it's an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling onSeeing that it's in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall outThere's a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There's several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it'll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for youIf you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out3. Squeeze instead of tapInstead of tapping on the earbuds, you are pinching or squeezing the stem.1x to play, pause, and answer calls2x to skip forward tracks3x to skip back tracksPress and hold to switch between active noise cancel and transparency modeStill able to say ""Hey Siri"" to do voice commands/adjust volume anytimeNo physical volume controls on buds4. Battery lifeBattery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimatesPro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode. You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you're not going to unless you're really desperate for batteryPro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hoursCase both old 24 hours battery lifePro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk5. Water/sweat resistantNow you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on.As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it's in-earMay survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though 6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency modeAirpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency modeActive nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I'd say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren't focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what's going on, but in general it does it's job.Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playingTransparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you're able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets.Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk7. Sound QualityBetter than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It's not $250 audiophile quality sound. Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to thoseYou can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice--Conclusion:Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation. There are other headphones that do it better sound in this price range, but may not be as convenient with pairing to Apple devices.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,List of Features/Changes compared to Airpods (v2),Vincent

"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2019",374 people found this helpful,I’m gonna start off saying that the noise canceling is amazing ide rate 10/10. Where the problem is is after wear for 3 minutes it begins to hurt my ears dramatically. I tried every tip and none of them work. It seems to be the design of the earbud itself. I’ve personally loved all of apples products but I think they should have worked a little harder on this one. I’ve done research and I’m not the only one experiencing pain. There is thousands who say the same thing. The original AirPods are great and feel amazing in my ears where sometimes I forget I’m wearing them.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2019",196 people found this helpful,"Apple AirPods Pro is one of the best noice cancelling in-ear headphones available in market. Price is on the upper end but the quality is also on the upper side compared to other models.I have QC35 and the noise canceling is comparatively good but being in-ear, the listening experience is much better.The transparency mode is awesome. It is like you NEVER wore the headphones. You have to try to experience it. I use it all the time in car and it is true “your gasoline car sounds like an electric car”.Fit is snug and with extra tips, most of the people can get accurate fit. Make sure to run sound seal test from Bluetooth setting of AirPods.Each earpiece is about 1.25 inch, little shorter than earlier versions but they still stuck out of your ear and look little weird.Out of box, it comes with Airpods with wireless charging case, extra tips and USB-C to lightning cable. Note that it does not come with charging brick which is a bummer. But you can charge it with any other lightning connectors.Overall these are pretty decent noice cancelling headphones.

But transparency mode amplified sounds like crazy. At the gym someone was moving weights, the cling of them hitting was so loud it hurt my ears. When I took the airpods out it was much quieter in real life. Even in noise cancelling mode they pick up voices and then they end up sounding robotic. There's a white noise in the background too. It's like a little static, annoying as hell.Just now I started hearing a popping noise in the right bud. It kept happening even when the music was off.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019",121 people found this helpful,"If you’re thinking about these and currently own the original style of AirPods, please check out my review below!Are these a replacement to the original AirPods? Not necessarily. I own these and two original style AirPods. I am an Apple fan girl and own one of everything they’ve got. But even then, I’m on the fence about the Pro’s. First off...Comfort and FitIf you’ve ever tried out the PowerBeats by Dre, they fit just like them minus that extra ear anchor. It takes some getting used to but thanks to transparency mode, I don’t think I could really wear another pair of IEMs / earbuds again. They 100% will not make you feel like your ears are clogged and not can you hear your own voice as one would with earbuds.However, I’m hung up on the fit. I was one of the lucky few who the original AirPods fit just right. However, these just hurt after 20-30 minutes. I tried all the different sizes of ear tips but none work. Ultimately, I wish Apple included foam versions of their ear tips. So be warned that these might hurt! Assuming they don’t hurt, then...Sound QualityThe sound quality is great. It’s nice and clear, balanced and at times not packing the bass I was possibly expecting. The HomePod has a very, very strong bass signature and I thought these would be similar. But, nope! When third party foam air tips come out, I’m pretty sure that will help the bass out. (Bass needs a good seal when it comes to earbuds.)Are these better than the original AirPods? Maybe. Because of that seal from the ear tips, the sound quality is drastically improved. With third party ear tips, the original AirPods sound pretty similar to these. I do appreciate the dynamic EQ which helps the sound a lot. But, be warned that they will sound like garbage if you have an EQ set in Apple Music on your iPhone. Make sure to set it to off or Late Night, otherwise they’ll sound a lot worse! Ultimately, you won’t be disappointed and they sound great, better than the originals because of that sound seal, but not mind blowing!Battery LifeThey’re pretty in par with the original AirPods with battery life even with Transparency and noise cancellation on. You can go all day with these just like the originals!SpeedThis is what I love about them the most! This is the reason why I prefer these over the original AirPods. The Pro’s are so much snappier with Handoff, switching from device to device, pausing and restarting, etc. They also more accurately get picked up by your iPhone and Apple Watch. I really wish they would upgrade the hardware in the original design just like these. (We’ll see!) also, the Pro’s more intelligently go on standby when out of your ear, resume faster when they go in your ear, etc. They just do everything faster! I also appreciate the fact that you pinch the stem instead of tapping them. Whoever thought of tapping didn’t realize how uncomfortable that “gesture” would be in practical usage.OverallI love them but they’re like the cousins of the original AirPods. They’re not a replacement but a different flavor. These are great for working out and stay in my ears during running. The new features and speed in combination with the improved sound delivery makes them an easy upgrade — so long as you find them comfortable, that is!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,AirPods vs AirPod Pro Review: My experiences,Lunar Kitten

Also it is much more comfortable than Powerbeats pro.• The ANC works surprisingly well. It is very similar to my beats studio 3. It is amazing how Apple fits everything Into such a small body.• The bass is better than AirPods 1 and 2. It feels more bouncy.Cons:• Since AirPods pro doesn’t support tap control any more. 2 fingers are required to pause or to control the AirPods, which IMO is not as good as tap control.Overall, it is good although a little pricy.Update:After using it for couple months, I have to say I was wrong about not falling off.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2019",60 people found this helpful,"I really like the old air pods and have bought a few for my family, also used them everyday for 8+ hours straight without any problem. Although the new air pods pro cost more and sounds great with some extra features, I don't think it's for me. If I use it for less than two hours or so there won't be any problems as it preforms very well. The main problem is that if I wear them for over 2+ hours they start to hurt both my ear which is weird because the older models ""wired/wireless"" I have no problem with while they are in my ear all day long. ""I have tried changing the rubber from large to small still doesn't help."" It seems like the new design are a little thicker than the older generations.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019",56 people found this helpful,"When I thought the old Airpods were already very good, Apple came out with something that's even significantly better.Pros:- Fits: very well. The old Airpods fit my ear well, these new ones fit even better. My ears do not get hurt after hours of wearing. And these do not even come close to falling out when I run.- Noise cancellation and transparency mode: both work amazingly.- Waterproof. However these are only splash proof. Meaning rain/spills/sweat are ok, but no swimming yet.- Sound quality: very decent. But probably not too insane to satisfy audiophiles.- Build quality: superior, as expected from Apple. Especially when consider small details like the silicon eartips. They snap extremely well into the Airpods and are very, very hard to remove.- Sync: very well with iPhone and Mac, as expected from Apple. Have not tested with Android, Windows.- Size: very conveniently small. You can easily wear them lying down in bed. Traveling case is also pretty small (just a tad bigger than old Airpods' case)- Design: this is very subjective. But I think the Airpods are the best looking earbuds in the market right now. Big reason why I choose them over other headphones.Cons:- Battery life: they're ok, I wish they last longer. Quote from Apple, battery lasts up to 4 hours 30 minutes of music time. In reality it lasts a bit more than 4 hours. But sometimes I wear them continuously way longer than that. Very sad.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Pretty much perfect,Nhat Vo

"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2019",29 people found this helpful,"I was very excited to try the new Airpods Pro, but unfortunately they are not for me. The main issue was the active noise cancellation (ANC). These were the first pair of ANC headphones I've owned, and it seems that I am in the minority of people who experience a strong negative reaction to ANC. Within moments of turning it on, I experienced head pressure, mild headache, and mild nausea. If you have never used ANC headphones before, be aware that the experience may not be as comfortable or magical as other say. Here is a breakdown of my thoughts on these Airpods:The Good:Fit: The fit was very comfortable and secure. I haven't tried the regular Airpods, but these fit great and seem very secure.Size: Both the Airpods and the charging case are compact and very portable. I have a pair of Bose Soundsport Free headphones and the charging case is at least 3 times larger than these.The mediocre:Sound: Based on reviews, I expected these to sound better. In fact, I thought they sounded worse with ANC on than off. Overall, I think my 2-year-old Bose Soundsports sound better, which is maybe not surprising but a bit disappointing given the price for these.The bad:ANC: Your mileage may vary, but I found using ANC a profoundly uncomfortable experience. I also felt like it did not cancel much more noise than having it off. Both of these factors negate one of the main selling points for these Airpods.Color: The Airpods and the case are dirt magnets. Even using them for less than a day, they were already picking up lots of dirt. I can't see keeping these clean in the long run.Overall: If ANC worked better for me, I could overlook the other shortcomings of these earbuds. As it is, I'll be sticking with my Bose Soundsports and sending these back.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Active Noise Cancellation Not For Me,Timothy P Sablik

Being an iPhone user I always saw the appeal of AirPods but never could use them due to them not fitting my ear correctly and always falling out. As soon as I saw the design of the AirPods pro I instantly came to amazon and ordered them. If you’re at all contemplating on ordering these I 100% recommend.

Maybe mine were defective; but, all of my music sounded crisp on the high end and peripherals, while feeling completely empty in the center. It is almost like Apple included an artificial surround enhancer or DSP, by default. Regardless, with the $250 price tag, I was told to expect better.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2020",19 people found this helpful,"UPDATE: These are literally designed to have a short lifespan. There is no way to fully discharge the batteries from both the case and the pods as the pods do not work if the case is dead, although they work without the case if you had already started using them. This is to depreciate the lifespan on the product itself. With lithium ion batteries you need to fully discharge between charges for the best battery life. Seems like Apple has designed these in a manner where you actually can’t do so. Pathetic.I really didn’t have crazy expectations for these but they’ve let me down in every way.-Doesn’t even come with a power block to charge the device, because they make you buy it separately.-Sound quality doesn’t match the price tag as it’s very heavy on the bass and mid range but treble is almost non-existent.-Water exposure rating is extremely poor, which won’t be covered by Apple care if you get these wet or too sweaty and they stop working.-Battery life should be better for the price tag as these do not last as long as advertised.-The case is poorly designed as it’s extremely easy to accidentally push the cap backwards which will break it off.-These are designed to be inoperable if they need maintenance or are malfunctioning as the housing is glued together. If you open them up, you’d never be able to put them back together again.-Since these cannot be repaired, it contributes to our global pollution problem as once you’ve reached your max recharge amount and degraded the battery, there’s nothing to do but throw them away and get new ones.Apple really needs to do better. This is just another example of how badly they’ve let these products slip.-No way to locate the device if it gets lost.-No security functions to keep strangers from making it their own if they find it or steal it.-Have to get a case for the case because it scratches insanely easily. What’s the point of designing something to look sleek when you have to put a bulky case on it?",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Do better Apple.,HelloHiThere

And the case provides many charge cycles before it’s depleted too.- The largest tips, which fit in my ears great, come loose, especially while jogging, very often and I have to keep pushing them back in ear...

"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2019",16 people found this helpful,"Enjoy immersive sound and optimal comfort with the Apple AirPods Pro with Wireless Charging Case, sweat- and water-resistant wireless Bluetooth earphones that use optical sensors and a motion accelerometer to detect when they're in your ears. The all-new, lightweight, in-ear design boasts a customizable fit while providing complete sonic performance. Use Active Noise Cancellation to keep you focused on enjoying your content, or switch to Transparency Mode to stay aware of what's going on in the environment around you.To ensure a rewarding listening experience, the AirPods Pro utilize Adaptive EQ to automatically sculpt the tonal output to suit your unique ear shape. Their custom high-excursion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers deliver clear, detailed sound with bass down to 20 Hz, all while keeping distortion low and upholding extended battery life. The flexible silicone eartips come in three sizes and advanced algorithms allow the AirPods Pro to analyze the fit and let you know if the current eartip size is giving the ideal seal.Following a single-tap setup, these AirPods automatically turn on and maintain their connection to your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac computer; forget having to manually engage or disengage power. Enjoy music, answer calls, or communicate with Siri on your mobile device without having to pull out your iPhone.These AirPods automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge—or 4.5 hours of listening time in Active Noise Cancellation mode, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a wireless charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time or over 18 hours of talk time. Just 5 minutes in the case gives you approximately one hour of listening time.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020",13 people found this helpful,"Let me clarify before getting into this: I drank the iJuice early on. I’ve always been an iPhone person, had a MacBook for college, and was gifted the first generation of AirPods which I immediately fell in love with. After 2 long, heavily-used years the first pair finally gave out. Bummer, but as a paralegal I had those things in ALL day, every day, and I’d never had a pair of headphones last me that long before.Naturally I was VERY excited to get these, knew they’d be worth the money, and was excited for all the new features.The noise cancellation is STELLAR. I mean borderline dangerous how little I can hear when it’s activated. Easy to switch on and off and the different sized earbuds they come with let you fit them perfectly.Battery life, as most Apple products in recent years, has improved. It’s not mind blowing, but you can get a solid 3 hours of listening, and the case itself will provide roughly 4-6 charges.Now for the iBummer... I ignored other reviews about this. Don’t make the same mistake. Based on other site’s reviews and discussions with others who have bought the Pros, it is an inevitable issue. The left AirPod, man. At first it dropped off here and there. No biggie, just put them in the case, close & open again, all set. It’s Bluetooth, it’s a piece of technology, it’s not perfect. It started happening more and more, but same fix. I became diligent with charging and cleaning them just to be safe (you’re supposed to clean any pair of headphones about once a week but like... come on), even got a case for the case. I figured a more advanced piece of technology would of course require some more careful maintenance. Then one day this frickin’ AirPod disconnected and has NEVER reconnected again. I’ve restarted, reconnected, rebooted, re-everything. I even got the new iPhone (again, drank the iJuice) amidst the month-long “pleasekeepworkingmamalovesyoudontgiveup” phase and hoped that an updated phone would alleviate. Nope.Apple customer service offered to send a new left earbud but they require a nearly $100 “refundable” (I’m sure they’d find a way to keep that) deposit and from what I’ve seen online it won’t make a difference. It makes me wonder if the case itself malfunctions or if it’s just the left AirPod. Anyways...Long story short: WASTE of $250. I’m returning them, it’s just not worth the trouble anymore and if I’m spending $250 on headphones when the phone already comes with a free, albeit corded, pair... I expect them to... work?

"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2019",14 people found this helpful,"Compared to the original AirPods, the form factor of the case and the earbuds just look awkward, but the functionality is great.This is the kind of the ugly older brother to the originals that is more powerful.TRANSPARENT MODETo me,the best feature is the “transparent mode” sound. This uses the microphones from the noise cancelling feature to actually pass ambient sound through to your ears while you listen to music or the phone. It seems like such a small feature, but ultimately, the ability to walk around with full environmental awareness AND music or your phone is pretty awesome. It makes the music presence more like high quality background sound All the time.NOISE CANCELLATIONI put these in when I was on a plane alongside my Bose Noise Canceling headphones. The performance was comparable or possibly even slightly better because these seal your ear. Given the match in performance, I’d rather wear these because it’s easier to sleep.SOFT BUD TIPSThe soft bud tips aren’t magic, they just work the way all other bud manufacturers have been doing for years. “Oooh, but Apple made them white and...“ nope, just soft tips. Move along.CHARGINGCompared to the originals, these function the same. If you have OCD and use your earbuds all day long, you may find they need to go into the case sooner by half an hour or something ... but I’ve seen no real difference in regular “in/out/in/out” daily use.CASEWith a millimeter difference here or there, it’s the same size as the original case, rotated 90 degrees.IPHONE INTEGRATIONSame special proprietary features as the originals, but the icon looks like a pair of confused ducks.OVERALLI wear them every day, leave them in when I’m not using them and consider them a key part of my work life for phone calls and music. Do they constitute a full upgrade to the originals? Not totally, but somewhat.The transparent sound is the main “wow” feature, and the noise cancellation is solid. If the loose feel of the originals bothered you, the new tips solve that. If you don’t care about the cost of buying new ones so soon after getting the originals, these are a worthwhile improvement on the originals and you’ll be happy.If I lost mine, I’d pay for another pair.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINALS,Malcolm

"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2019",11 people found this helpful,"As an owner of the 1st gen and 2nd gen AirPods I can honestly say these are worthy of the upgrade. The ear tips are much more comfortable than I imagined they would be for extended wearing and also hold them in place. With older AirPods design they would fit but when moving around and even just talking (moving your jaw) they would wriggle from their set position. Also, I didn't care for the loud sound pressure transferred to your eardrum when tapping to issue commands either of the older generation units. These new Pro model buds have a pressure sensor on each bud stem you press/pinch to activate features. They make little single click/tick sound when pressed. One press for Play/Pause/Answer/Hangup, Two-presses for next track, Three-presses for previous track. So far the best feature is noise cancellation which is fantastic. Calgon, take me a away. The peacefulness is bliss. The only nag I have so far is with the shorter stem they can be a little fumbly putting them into and getting them out of the charging case. I haven't had them long enough to test call-quality (both audio and microphone quality) but will update if anything comes up. I did make sure the firmware updated to latest version as I've heard others speak of microphone call quality with original/shipping firmware version, so I am interested to see if this new version resolves it. All in all I can highly recommend them and will come back and either bump rating to 5 stars or keep it at 4Update ~6 month (04/17/2020). Still at 4-stars. All in all a decent upgrade over Gen 2 AirPods and best wireless buds out there I think. Still some software/firmware bugs requiring to put back in case or reset and repairing them to get them working again. Also, microphone voice quality is horrible. On par with gen1 and gen2 AirPods and this is one of the major items I hope Apple targets for the next model(s). Mic noise cancellation is pretty good but voice quality is just lacking. Some would call fidelity of the microphones very compressed and tinny. If you can pick these up for 235+tax they are a decent deal. If they’d get to 199+tax it would be much better.

I have had every generation of the airpods (e.g. Airpods 1 and Airpods 2). Why did I get these? Well, because I lost my previous Airpods and I was intrigued by the anti-sweat claims of this product. However, I am on the fence as to whether to return them because after about 30 minutes of a hard run, the silicon tips kept coming out. Every time I would try to push them back in it was awkward because I was running fast. What's more, each time I tried to readjust the tips and jam them into my canal (imagine me doing this running a 6:30 mile), I kept hitting the button on the stem and stopping/the music. For the last 10 minutes of my run I just threw the airpods into the treadmill cup. I am now trying smaller buds in hopes that they will work. I will say that the noise cancellation and the transparency mode is amazing. The speaker and sound is superb. But that won't mean much if my main use case (running with these on at high speeds and with lots of sweat) doesn't work. I will update this review in a week or so.UPDATE: I am definitely returning these. The first Apple product that I am extremely disappointed in. The left Airpod fell out multiple times during my run yesterday at high intensity. What is more, the Airpod has started emitting a high-pitched squeak/squeal sound. You can do a Google search on this and many users have complained of this. It appears to be related to the noise cancelling feature and there is definitely a design flaw.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2020",8 people found this helpful,"Both the Apple Airpods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds had very good reviews so I decided to purchase both and see which one worked for me.Sound:I have been in audio engineering for 40 years but honestly sound is a very personal thing. Some people like heavy bass while I prefer a genuine full spectrum experience, as if I were sitting in front of a live orchestra. That said, I suspect the Sony earbuds will make the bass aficionado very happy. In my opinion they lacked a full range experience while the Apple was very refreshing making every instrument stand out, even the softest notes. Both had good quality as far as NO distortion even at max volume. Speaking of volume, the Sony could not achieve the same loudness as the Apple. (I should also point out that I was using an Apple iPad Pro as my source device, not that it ""would or should"" make a difference) The Apple also had better clarity most likely because the Sony bass drowns everything else out making it sound a bit muddy.Comfort:In my opinion the Apple wins this one hands down. The Sony is much heavier and seems to run a bit hot as my ears literally burn when I use them. I can't imagine trying to listen long term with the Sony while the Apple earbuds feel very comfortable for the long haul. They both have different size buds that can be interchanged very easily. The Sony has more options and even has two different materials that might appeal to someone who has skin allergy. The down side of the Apple might be that because they are so light it might be easier to loose them however if one the Apple buds fall out, the sound comes to a halt on both which is very nice. Another thing to point out for the athletic type is that the Apple is sweat resistant where the Sony is not.Function and Control:I hate to keep harping on the Sony but once again it mostly fails in this category. One thing the Sony has that I truly like is the ability to pass through external sounds by simply touching and holding the left bud. This also pauses what you are listening to while you attend to the interruption. Once you release your finger it resumes your music or whatever you are listening to. Unfortunately the Sony tap (touch) control for pausing, advancing and changing sound modes are hit or miss at best. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't making for a very frustrating experience. The Apple has a little microswitch on each bud that consistently works as advertised. Either left or right bud of the Apple perform the same function while the left and right buds of the Sony have unique functions. The Apple has a seal test that you can run in the app settings to help you get a good fit.UPDATE: After loading the latest firmware the controls are much better for the Sony. No other improvements noted.Carrying Case:On both of these the case function as an integral part of the system. They both have internal batteries that charge the buds while the buds are in the case. The Apple case is a bit smaller and lighter making it the better choice for my pocket. The Apple can also be charged wirelessly or by USB cable where the Sony must use a cable only. The Sony is more stylish and feels more expensive. I haven't yet tested battery run time but from what I've read, they are both similar.Summary:Overall the Apple is my pick and makes me very happy. I'm sure there are many more options one might consider concerning either of these brands but this is just my experience in a nutshell and I hope it is helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Apple vs Sony,Sequestre

Oddly, it was when I was walking and my hand would hit my phone in my pocket.I probably won’t buy this shape of true wireless headphones when purchasing in the future, unless they are able to reduce the ear bud size or improve its comfort.I do appreciate the compact recharging case, addition of the silicone ear piece, reduced profile of the external control stems, and the control functions and stable communication with my iPad 7 and iPhone 11.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Not for tiny ears,Jesse

"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019",7 people found this helpful,"Not worth the money. Very disappointed in the noise cancellation. I’ve worn these on a plane and they only cancel out about 60% of the engine noise. I occasionally work in a large data center where there’s a consistent equipment hum of about 84 decibels, and I estimate that these are only blocking out about 75% of the noise. The noise cancellation software needs some serious updating. The sound transparency mode is pretty good so that you can hear people talking and sounds around you. There’s just a slight filtering of the sound, so it’s not completely transparent. Good enough to leave the EarPods in and still hear what’s going on around you.The BIG downside to these are that the EASILY fall out!! I’ve tried the different sized ear tips, and ran the Air Pods Pro sound/noise cancellation tests and I’m using the correct size tips. On a plane, I nodded off for a bit and woke up to a missing AirPod. I had to wait until the plane landed and everyone got off to search for the AirPod. It rolled a few rows back winding up under a seat with a bunch of garbage and dirt. On a return trip, I put them in, and within 5 minutes, one fell out again. Forget about moving around with them in, as they will definitely fall out. If you bend over, they fall out. You will find yourself constantly pushing them in to avoid losing them. I had to buy a silicone strap to keep the two attached to each other so the don’t venture off. The use of the strap is ridiculous, and shouldn’t be necessary, but I don’t feel like buying a replacement AirPod and wasting more money.The battery charge lasts at least five hours, and charges quite quickly in the included charging case.Overall, save yourself about $200 and spend $50 on a decent pair of wired ear buds, which will have the same audio quality.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2020",5 people found this helpful,"I'm a runner, and I bought these to replace the headphones I used exclusively for running since they were IPX5. These also offer some IP rating that should ensure I won't have issues running. I transitioned to these from some Liberty bluetooth headphones I really liked. These weigh less, and the sound quality is not really an improvement, but since they allow Siri hands-free, they get an overall bump in performance over the ones I'm coming from.Pros:1) Fantastic noise isolation/cancellation. My Liberties had this feature, but there is an improved isolation to these headphones that allows for a more natural sound profile than the last ones achieved. There is less bass in these headphones, but they sound better because the music and voices (in podcasts) are reproduced more naturally.2) They're made by Apple for an Apple ecosystem, and since I drank all their Kool-Aid I own a bunch of Apple gear. They work with all of it, and allow Siri hands-free, which really helps if my hands are full or if I'm running and want to turn down the volume without trying to mess around with my watch dial.3) They're pretty comfortable. I had the regular Airpods, and these rubber tips make for a better seal and ever so slightly more comfortable fit while walking around. While running, however, these are FAR AND AWAY much better than regular Airpods. I do like the tap feature on Airpods better than the squeeze feature on these, however. I wish these had the tap gestures instead.CONS:The reasons they don't get 5 stars from me are:1) The tips won't fit my left ear properly. The regular size fits my right perfectly. The left one small, medium, and large will not get a proper seal. I use them now with the regular one and deal with the fact my left ear isn't a perfect ""size"" for these tips. I did have the same issue with the Liberty ones, so it's not isolated to Apple. That's not an issue in and of itself to drop a star. But in addition:2) There is some bad wind noise when I use these running. I had no wind noise to speak of when using the Liberty bluetooth set. It's worse if I listen to podcasts than it is when I listen to music. I console myself with the fact that on the second half of my runs, when the wind is at my back, it disappears. But it's a little disappointing to have the superb noise isolation/cancelling not be able to deal with the wind.3) The battery life on the case is ok. It's not bad, but just ok. And the first time I charged it, it only went up 10% in three hours (using the supplied USB C to Lightning, plugged into a $249 CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 docking station). When I switched it to a wall outlet, the charging was normal, but I use that docking station to charge an iPad Pro 2018 with no issues. Maybe it was an anomaly, it was the first charge, and I've had these only a couple weeks.Overall, I'd rate them 4 stars. I almost went with 3 stars, but when I use them inside, they're a 6 out of 5, and they work so well with my iPhone, and we SOOOOO much less than the liberties with almost the same sound quality, and they are pretty seamless moving from iPhone to Apple Watch when I go running and leave my phone at home. So overall, they deserve more than a 3-star rating.I'm keeping them, but that is due in large part to the fact that I bought them on sale for $199, and when Apple headphones drop under $200, the AppleCare+ also drops from $29 to $19, so I got Airpods Pro with AC+ for 2 years for $218 and for that price, I can run to my heart's content knowing if I have any issues between now and Sep 2022 I'll get a replacement. That also offsets some of the issues I have with them, so I feel like 4 stars is a fair rating for these. If I had paid $249 plus $29 for AppleCare+ I would return them. I would recommend them only if the price dips again below $200.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Good noise isolation, poor wind blocking",Jason E Horvath

I still don't know how much it cancels out, but I love them! I wear them when driving a no cab JD 4010 tractor wide open. It blocks most of the tractor noise out, and I don't even have to have the volume turned up high. I also wear them while driving the skid steer. It does a great job of blocking out the back ground noise. If someone calls me while on a very loud tractor, I can hear them great, but they have trouble hearing me, which is totally understandable. I can have conversations with people while in the skid steer. The skid steer doesn't run too loud that people can't hear me during conversation.These airpods are very handy. I work in construction, and it is very convenient to be able to walk around the job site and talk on the phone without having to have my phone in my hand. Another great benefit is that I can leave my phone on the charger and walk around my house talking to someone on the phone. I also wear them while walking or jogging. I live in the country and don't have side walks to walk on. I walk/jog down the road. Even with the noise cancellation I can still hear most all vehicles when they are coming from behind. I've only been startled a few times.I really love that the airpods charge in the case, so you can get many hours of use, before you actually have to charge the case.My only compliant is that if I am talking on the phone without the airpods and then put one or both in my ears, it does take several seconds for it to connect to the airpods.

The noise cancellation is best for music. The transparency mode is good for just leaving them in your ears to hear other surrounding noises. They have transparency mode, noise cancellation mode, and NC Off mode that is somewhere in between the other two modes. I use NC off for telecons, transparency mode between calls, and NC for music.These are especially good for me since I can only hear out of one ear so I no longer have to rotate which arm is holding the phone to my one good ear or use speaker phone. I can actually rotate the two Airpods in my one ear as the batteries die (about every 3 hours with calls on and off).Using the right one in my left ear takes a little extra care when inserting it to ""trick"" the sensors but you can put it in your ear pointing up, allow it to initialize, and then rotate it down and it works fine.LOVE 'EM.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Excellent purchase,RC

It sounds like the microphones that are used for ANC (or one of the other mics) is actually picking up reverberations from inside the earpiece, and causing massive amounts of feedback.

I have a mix of products with different operating systems; I have a Google Pixel phone, an iPad, and a Windows PC. These earbuds luckily work with all of these products pretty flawlessly with occasional hiccups on Windows, though of course they work the best with my iPad. I got these on sale for $170 because personally the $250 price tag was just too much for me, and at this price they are a steal. I would say if you can get these for $200 or lower they are well worth the cost.Pros:- Sound. Sound quality is really good for most music. I'm a bit of a bass head so I don't get the fullest experience I would like out of these, but I still enjoy the clarity of the music. I did not get these specifically for bass, as I knew they would not be bass-heavy, which is why this is still a pro for me. If you listen to lots of hip hop or indie music these sound great.- Features. The ANC on these is not the best, but you should not expect the best from little earbuds at this cost. These block out my loud air conditioner and a lot of other white noise with a consistent sound wave. These do not block out loud sudden noises like typing or people conversing, though they do a good job quieting things down through noise isolation from a good seal. Transparency mode on these is amazing as well; with them on, it really sounds like there is nothing in your ears (except your own voice will sound slightly muffled to you). I am continuously amazed by how well transparency mode works and I can see the use cases for them only building.- Comfort. Honestly, with the relief of pressure Apple put into these with the little vents on the bottom of the AirPods, I forget these are in my ears. They are so comfortable to wear, which says a lot for someone with small, sensitive ears. This may differ if these don't fit your ears properly, which I will mention later.- Portability. The charging case is nice and compact, and even with a silicone case on top of it I can easily slip them in small pockets of bags and in large pockets. The AirPods themselves are quite small and I can see someone misplacing them if they lay them down somewhere and forget about them, but they're bigger than a lot of other TWS earbuds I've owned so hopefully I will be able to keep track of them.- Seamlessness with Apple products. AirPods are, of course, Apple made. Therefore they are designed to work with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Macbooks. These pause and play instantaneously with my iPad and I can access all the special features you get specific to Apple.- Presentation. Apple wins on sleekness. Not much else to say about that.Medicorities:- The fit of these is pretty good for the average ear, but if you have smaller ear canals like me they can be just a little troublesome. My left ear canal is almost too small for the smallest tip of these, but with maneuvering I can still get a good seal. They fall out if I lay on my arm in bed, but other than that they stay in. Definitely try all the earbud sizes.- The magnet for the lid of the case is pretty sturdy though not super strong, so I find it sometimes opens when I carry them around. This doesn't happen too often but be aware of that.Cons:- Price. As I stated before I don't think these are worth $250. I think $200 is just right for them, and the extra $50 is simply paying for the Apple branding. This is why I'm not a huge Apple fan.- Not seamless with non-Apple products. If you only use Apple, these will work great for you so disregard this point. I didn't expect these to work with everything, though an Android app would be nice. If Samsung can make an app for their Galaxy Buds for iOS devices, I think Apple can do the same for Android. I have connection issues on occasion with my Windows PC, and taking out and AirPod does not in any way auto-pause/play on Windows nor Android. All stem pressing functions do work as they are supposed to though. This is a mix between a mediocre feature and a con for me.Tl;dr I think that the pros outweigh the cons for the AirPods Pros, and I recommend them for anyone looking for great sound with any device. Apple could be a little more friendly to those who don't buy everything Apple, but from a competitive standpoint I get it. I can see myself using these on a daily basis and I think they are a great buy if you can get them under $200.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great Noise Cancelling Earbuds for Anyone,Amazon Customer

I will be using both in Transparency Mode so I can hear navigation, texts, etc. more loudly. The silicone tips did not work well for me. I purchased some memory foam tips that work great.The size and weight of the Airpods is great. They’re nothing like the original Bluetooth earpieces from the early 2000s.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"Pros:The AirPod Pro are a very good set of earbuds, in fact it’s one of the best I’ve used. As an iPhone user, I have no complaints on the ease I have with pairing these earbuds with my, as I was able to pair with them with my iPhone in less than a minute, with no effort on my part. Everything as far as personalizing the AirPod Pro’s ID name, or whether or not if I wanted the earbuds in transparent versus full noise-canceling mode, or even how I wanted to set up how I wanted each earbud to function (e.g. change song, pause, skip, etc.) was super easy.Wireless recharging of the earbuds in their case on a Qi-certified device is a piece of cake. Simply put the earbuds into your carrying case, and set it on the charging device, and wait for the case color to change to a green light. Apple does include both three sizes of earplugs and a Lightening Cable to recharge your earbuds and case. The noise-canceling function is good, and does block-out a log of ambient noise. I haven’t tested how effective they are while traveling in an airplane (which is the true test of noise canceling earbuds), so I can’t rate them as to how effective they are. I’m sure there’s a ton of YouTube videos, but I can’t personally attest to how well they perform in that specific environment.The earbuds seem to be very resistant to sweat, which is something I like. I like to listen to music while I work out, I haven’t had issues with AirPod Pro performance while working out for an hour. I’ve had issues with knock-off AirPods – simply a case of you get exactly what you pay for scenario.Cons:The biggest con of these earbuds is the fit in my ear whenever I exercise. No matter what size earbud-tip I use when I exercise (i.e. running / aerobics), the earbuds want to fall out of my ears. I ended up having to purchase a pair of knock-off Bose ProFit earbud attachments from eBay for a few Dollars (see the review photo of what I used), just so these Airpod Pros wouldn’t fall out of my ears while I’m exercising. The attachments I bought from eBay didn’t help too much in keeping the Airpods in my ears while working-out, but it was a slight improvement over the Apple-furnished earbud attachments. The security of the earbuds to stay in place while exercising seems to be a design-flaw overlooked by Apple, and I'm surprised their Engineering staff didn't notice this during product development.The other con is the battery life leaves something to be desired. I’ve been on teleconference calls that lasted slightly over two hours (yes…trust me, I know it's a long teleconference), and gotten iPhone warning notifications of battery life of my AirPods. That was a little surprising since the AirPod Pros were less than 2 months old, at the time of usage and notification. This would be a warning I would expect for a device that was either somewhat old, or an inexpensive knockoff you’d purchase at a discount department store. Granted – I was using noise canceling the entire time of the call, and not the ambient mode to perhaps save some power; however, less than three hours of continuous usage and still getting low battery notifications left me a little disappointed.Overall Rating:I’d still recommend them, despite the few shortfalls of these AirPod Pros. If you feel noise-canceling isn’t worth the upgrade, the basic AirPods are still a VERY good substitute device to purchase and can save you some money. The wireless charging is nice, but to me seemed a little bit gimmicky and useless – more so if you don’t own any other Qi-charging capable devices or Qi-charging stations, or if you happen to purchased a silicone protective case for the AirPod Pros to prevent them from getting scratched or damaged. I managed to purchase these AirPod Pros during an Amazon Black-Friday Sale, so I was able to save some money. If I were to purchase them at full-price, I would have to seriously weigh whether or not it is worth it, if I intend to use them for both work and when I go to the gym. If using only for work, it might be worth it, if I were in a somewhat noisy room whenever I have telecom's (if you have a neighbor using a leaf blower, noise-canceling can only do so much). If I were only using it for when I exercise, I would have to seriously consider purchasing a set of earbud attachments, so to keep the earbuds from falling out of my ears when working-out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,WOW....Just WOW!,Jon Ig

Unfortunately, they would either slip out of my ear (almost lost one on a walk), or they would feel like they were slipping out of my ear, despite trying the various size earbud adapters. I especially like how you can share your audio, as my fiancée and I did on a walk. I tried some 3rd party earbud adapters, which fit better, but weren’t as comfortable. Apple - why just put a soft loop around the ear like Bose and Beats and be done with it? At the end of the day, it was too unnerving walking around with expensive electronics in my ear never knowing when I might lose them. I returned them. I hope they’ll have a more secure design with the AirPods Pro 2. Of you cruise the internet, you’ll see a number of people experience the same problem. Also, the noise cancellation didn’t knock my socks off. However, transparency mode was really nice.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"I bought these to help block out distracting office noise. Unfortunately (and ironically), the noise cancelling algorithm on these actually make the distractions worse. The AirPods Pro removes the white noise that had been masking conversations and abrupt sounds. With them in, it's actually harder to concentrate. I truly hope the magicians at Apple can improve the noise cancellation program via firmware update. It is not in the same league as Bose and Sony at this point. It is also not as customizable.As far as sound quality goes, I had been scared by other reviewers into thinking these were absolute garbage. I'm happy to say that's not the case. They are generally balanced and pleasant to listen to. The bass is present but not over-accentuated. The mids and highs are also present but not irritating. It's close to being good. There are better options out there, obviously. My favorite pair of wireless ears is the Bose SoundSport Wireless, which is, by the way, cheaper and more appropriate for working out. Apple's sound should have a bit more low frequency extension and more customizability. By the way, having a good tight fit in crucial to achieving proper low-end response on any in-ear headphone. So if the bass sounds weak to you, try a bigger tip and make sure to push it in snugly!As far as the mic, it's OK. It sounds about like you'd expect. Everything else works pretty flawlessly. The charging case is easy and intuitive. Putting them in your ears (one or both) is easy and intuitive. Pairing them was a breeze. They look pretty good too, if that's important to you.It's a 50/50 toss up now if I return them or not. I already have better sound in the Bose SoundSport Wireless, and these are not adding the noise cancelling functionality I was hoping for.UPDATE: It may be placebo effect, but I think the most recent firmware update really has helped the noise cancelling feature on these perform better. They are still not on par with Sony's technology, but it seems better. You just have to add a little noise from the Coffetivity app or the White Noise app to further drown out the office noise.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Not comfortable; great sound quality and noise cancellation (comparing regular and Pro),Johnny Doe

"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"Oh my goodness. These are incredible.1) Background & Comparison:I have had the Bose QC35 headphones for a year, and just purchased the Bose SoundSport Free (after purchasing the AirPods Pro) and love them both, but these AirPods Pro buds are SO lightweight I actually forgot I had left one in my ear at work the other day (no music playing of course). I don’t see a need for wearing my QC35s anymore because they’re heavy and large. After I purchased the AirPods Pro, purchased a pair of Bluetooth Bose Soundsport Free to compare sound and bass. Sound quality is great on the SoundSport Free model but I have issues with the size (even smalls tips hurt my ears) and they are bulky. Sorry, Bose, I really wanted to love your product but the AirPods Pro win for me due to size, ease of use, and comfort.——2) Fit:My ears hurt with a lot of earbuds styles bc I have smaller ears, but the medium sized tips surprisingly fit great. There’s functionality to test the ear tip fit while you have them in your ear - I assume it tests pressure and seal that the tips make in your ear canal. They also don’t fall out and seem completely snug. I did work out in them, but haven’t run or done any kind of strenuous activity with them, but would be interested to see if they stay in while running. So far, I would assume they do based on the secure fit.——3) Noise cancellation & transparency mode:I work in an open office and was completely shocked by the noise cancellation mode. It is AWESOME and really muffled out most (95%?) of the noise. I might wear these at work without playing music just so it’s quiet and I can focus better. Transparency mode is excellent for doing things around the house or wearing on a trail where I need to be cognizant of surroundings, and still want to hear my music.——4) Audio quality:I feel like I don’t need to turn these up as loud as I have had to with other brands. Ear tip fit is great and sound is crystal clear. I wish they had more bass, but I do find the bass quite sufficient. I generally seek out bass in my headphones because of personal preference, and I’m happy with them. I do wish there was an equalizer to be able to adjust the settings for the use, but I’ll leave that to my music apps to do. Sound quality is great and I hope it will save my ears a little bit from not having to turn them up like I have had to with my other earbuds previously.——5) Conclusion:These are amazing. Form and function are great, and most of all, they are lightweight and ease of use is excellent.

Meaning, you can mute all surrounding noise just like an ear plug.I was surprised also that Noise Cancellation works for the other party if you’re making a phone call. For example, I was talking to my wife while standing next to my noisy AC compressor in my backyard, but after applying noise cancellation she only heard my voice; the noise that came from the compressor completely disappeared.Transparency mode saves us the embarrassment when someone talks to us while listening to music. Transparency mode enables the other microphone on the AirPod so that you can hear your surroundings at the same time you’re listening to your device.And by the way, you can use one airpod at a time with both features, noise cancellation and transparency. I am deaf in my right ear so I can take my AirPod for the right ear place it in my left ear upside down and it works just fine. The AirPod is so very light, and after a few minutes of wearing it you don’t even feel it’s there.

I tested both LG and AirPod Pro and the Pros comes in first because it does block out any noise from the outside - I would say mostly 80%. I also hear that it adapts to the sound to actively block out any noise outside especially when I shop: I can’t hear my footsteps, the people around, the car on the streets. It’s amazing! Plus I can leave them in my ear and they are so comfortable, especially when I’m on the treadmill they stick like glue! Plus it helps with the sweat resistant feature the AirPods provide!

It lowers the volume so you’re able to better hear what’s going on around you.3. Battery life is on par with most other wireless earbuds I’ve tried. I like that I can wirelessly charge the case since it doesn’t come with the required usb-c cable. (Apple is going to nickel and dime us to death.)4. Other features I liked are the touch controls, Siri, and sense features. Siri works much better when I’m using my AirPods. I set Siri to work with my left AirPod so all I have to do is click once to activate her. But I mainly use voice to activate her which works just as well. Touch controls are easy and provide haptic feedback as well, another feature I appreciate. AirPods sense when you place them in your ear. So if you need to pop them out for a quick second to talk, your music/video/podcast is paused. It resumes on its own once you place your AirPod back in your ear.5. My main complaint with my AirPods is the fit. They come with three different earbud tips. I started with medium but found them to be too big. My AirPods kept falling out after a few minutes of use. So I dropped down to the smallest size. These worked well for the first few weeks of use. But now I’m noticing my AirPods shift more and I keep having to reorient them every few minutes. Perhaps it’s due to the material the tips are made from? Maybe implementing a slight texture would help.Final impression - Solid earbuds with excellent sound. Siri seems to be at its best when paired with AirPods. But the price tag is still a turnoff. If you’ve got the spare cash, go for it. Otherwise there are a lot of great alternatives out there for much less.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Best Wireless Earbuds Yet,A. Fontenot

I'm kind of annoyed that I had to go and purchase a seperate $20 USB C charging block to plug the charging cable into. These airpods do charge wirelessly in the case but you will eventually need to recharge the case up which is why they include a chaging cord but it is USB C to take note of that. There is also no volume control on the earbuds. You need to go to your phone which can be inconvenient if jogging or working out with them. They also do not cancel low frequency sound from neighbor's audio equipment but then nothing so far has.

The ""spacial"" sound setting (which is accessed through you iPhone Bluetooth settings) didn't seem to do anything. Then one day it kicked in for a few minutes, and the sound was fantastic! But then it quit. I called Apple support, and they had me completely reset my iPhone. That didn't solve it. But the support person talked to someone else who said to turn off the ""mono"" setting located in my phones ""Accessibility"" settings. That solved it (Did I have to do a complete phone reset??).However, I have an ongoing issue. If I set a timer on my Apple Watch, when it ends, it causes the music I'm listening to, to stop and the only way I can get it to go through the Airpods again is to disconnect the Bluetooth and reconnect it because the Bluetooth connection crashes. I frequently will be listening to music at the gym and set a timer to monitor time between sets, but I have to ""watch"" the timer, because if it gets down to zero and goes off it will cause the bluetooth connection to crash. The same thing happens if I get an incoming phone call while listening to music. Additionally, the Bluetooth connection drops often, and for no reason. Also, sometimes the touch pads don’t work right.Also, they do occasionally fall out of my ears, despite having the best size earplug on them (they come with 3 sizes of silicon ear plugs).Noise cancellation isn't great. that is, I can still hear things around me between songs with transparency turned off.ALSO, only when I have these in, it will turn the volume down automatically, and a warning will come up that says 'You have exceeded the weekly volume allowance and the volume has been turned down'. WHAT?! I don't need ""big brother Tim Cook/Apple"" telling me how to listen to these! Give me a break.Overall, the sound with these is great, and the touch pad control is nice (I wish volume could be controlled), but my old wired earphones were better in many respects.UPDATE: The issues with these continued to get worse, so I have returned them.

Let me tell you, I was expecting to try them and then return them within a few days, but that was not the case at all. I ended up loving them. They have managed to stay in place despite the earrings and the size of my ear and the small ear tips were just what my ears required for such a device. It's amazing how having that smaller option aside from medium and large makes such a BIG difference.The only thing is, if I am not playing my music loud, I can hear the outside world with the noice cancelling option on, but in reality it's still better than I expected and it doesn't impact my ability to hear the music or phone call at all. The transparency mode is amazing, if you compare it between the noice cancellation and off options, you hear everything as you should without the pods in your ears at all. That being said, if you compare the noice cancellation to the transparency mode, you can hear the difference.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I've had these for about a month now, and I can give the following review with confidence: These are great for the average person. They're very comfortable, stay in well for a jog, and the sound quality and features are all great. Pairing and connectivity to the iPhone is smooth, as expected. The fit is excellent, I think it was nice touch including different sizes of ear gummies. I personally use the smallest ones. You can wear them pretty much all day without discomfort.The active noise cancellation -- They work, but they're not perfect. This features blocks out every day noises pretty well, and in conjunction with the audio from whatever you're listening to I'd say they drown out outside noises very well; I wouldn't go as far as to call it ""noise cancelling"" though. I'd say half the time they actually completely cancel noises, and the other half they'll muffle noises enough to make it easy for you to ignore and focus on whatever you're listening to. Overall, they're excellent. I do not consider myself an audiophile. As an average user, I'd say I am beyond happy with the results.The transparency mode -- I think this is underrated. It is amazing for when you're goin on jogs, as it allows you to enjoy your music while still being aware of your surroundings. I also enjoy that because you can hear yourself better, you speak at a more reasonable volume on the phone. I find myself speaking regularly instead of shouting during phone calls because I can tell that I'm speaking at a normal volume. I'm not sure if anybody else feels the need to talk louder with headphones / earphones in because their own voice is muffled, and they don't think they're speaking loud enough...but if you are, I hope you can relate to this tangent.The mic -- Good enough. I haven't been told that I sounded weird over the phone. No complaints on clarity of my speech either.Overall, great headphones. Comfortable, definitely an upgrade from the first gens I had. The features are great for an average user; I use both the transparency and noise cancellation modes all the time. Would definitely recommend it for everyday use.

I bought them on 2/15 and they stopped working again yesterday, 3/8/2021, less than 30 days later but VERY CLOSE to the 30 day mark (AGAIN). SAME PROBLEMS as before. They don't charge evenly. I have to jiggle them around for the charger to pick up both AirPods, just like the pair before. I thought maybe that was normal and overlooked it. Yesterday, they quit working all together, as the previous pair did. You'll know that they have stopped working when you put them in your ear and you don't hear a sound but it still shows connected to your phone. I have disconnected, reset them, unpaired them, restarted my phone, recharged them, re-paired them, EVERYTHING multiple times and they don't work. The right one gave out first, which makes sense because I use the right one more than the left. Now when I put it in my ear, it's just silence. I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD THEM 30 DAYS!!! I think these are SCAMS because this is my SECOND pair from Amazon to do this and my cousin had the same exact issue with hers from Amazon and ended up buying a new pair from Apple. They also stay connected as if they're in your ears when they're in the case. Totally faulty, no wonder they were $50 off.

Then my son got some AirPods Pro's and I tried them out. The bass alone was enough to get me to make the upgrade. But then I got them and realized there is so much more to them. With the noise cancelling feature, and the spatial audio, I am blown away with these.Spatial Audio, for those that don't know, is a feature where if you're using the AirPods Pro's to watch a movie that supports it, if you turn your head, the audio stays in the direction of the screen. It makes it more like watching a movie in a room or theater. In some cases you can actually ""feel"" the audio coming from the screen. It's hard to describe, but really incredible to experience. I've told a few people about getting the Pro's and it's the first thing I tell them about. Makes watching a movie with these very immersive.Noise cancelling is great as well. If you've never tried headphones with noise cancelling before, you're missing out. I don't think I could say these do it better than anyone else, but they certainly work well. I can barely hear my wife when she's sitting right next to me and trying to ask a question. Luckily there's a simple toggle where you can hold the AirPod on the stem to disable it to allow outside noise in. The most useful time for this feature is when mowing the lawn.

The other ear buds I was using were very clunky when switching between devices. I am a macbook/iPhone user and do zooms and calls all day long so that's an important feature to me. The air pods pro are very good in that regard.Fit and comfort has always been a complaint of mine when it comes to air pods. The original air pods I thought represented the pinnacle of Apple's arrogance: one single hard plastic size will suffice for everyone. The originals were terrible IMO and hurt my ears and didn't stay. The air pods pro feature a soft rubber tip (three sizes) which in my experience is just slightly better. For me, I've yet to find the right fit that will stay in my ear -- and I'm not even talking while being active, I'm sitting at a desk working and talking and they fall out.The noise cancellation function is really very good with the different settings offered. I am impressed by this as I have not had that feature in the past.Here's my biggest gripe and I REALLY hope it's solvable or these earbuds will be worthless. For whatever reason, it seems like all ear bud makers place a VERY high value on having some touch features that control devices associated with each earbud -- volume, pause/play, switching between noise settings. It's overcooked in my opinion and is not a feature I'm looking for. And here is why: if you are constantly having to fiddle with the earbud to make sure it stays in your ear, you will unavoidably trigger these features inadvertently.And the biggest headscratcher of all: DEAR APPLE - WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU EVER HAVE A ""FEATURE"" WHERE ME TOUCHING MY EARBUD HANGS UP A CALL?!?! WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!!!!!! Gosh, I wonder if it was foreseeable that users would touch/adjust their earbuds from time to time and that hanging up calls as a result would be an undesirable outcome?? This doesn't happen once in a blue moon, it happens ALL THE TIME. I'm trying to figure out how to disable these ""features,"" but as seems common to Apple's design hubris, they are certain they know better than I which features are useful and which should be cast into the abyss. I've just ordered some aftermarket, third-party foam replacement tips in the hopes this will help with fit and maybe solve this problem. But if that doesn't solve the problem, I'll probably return these because it turns out that regularly hanging up calls/zooms is not a useful feature for me.I hope to update this review with more experience and hopefully resolved issues.

I can have these on at work and still hear the work phone/ coworkers if need be. The battery life in general for most buds still needs work, but the charging case does wonders. I'll typically get about 4ish hours of sound and then put them in the charging case. I leave work at 4:30 and decided to put them in to charge at 4:13. When I left they went from 0-73% so I was really impressed by the fast charging.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and even though the price tag is high(like most Apple products) I feel I can justify it with how premium this feels.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Finally Apple gets wireless buds right,Jeramie

It's been awhile since I had a pair of ""in-ear"" earbuds and I was perfectly content with my first generation Airpods. But I'm easily lured by shiny new technology and had to try them out. Here are a few thoughts:1. They're comfortable. There are multiple size ear tips that can be used to customize the fit. The ear tips are a soft material that sit easily and comfortably inside the ear.2. The noise cancellation is pretty impressive. I have Bose QC25s and Beats Studio 3s and the Airpod Pros make a good showing up against the two sets of noise cancelling headphones. (I know neither are rated the best as noise cancelling headphones but just comparing to what I have.)3. The case is just a touch larger than the original Airpod cases but just so. Still pocketable and still tiny.4. Battery life is excellent; I haven't charged them more than once in the last month with using them once every few nights for an hour or so.I've heard some people using both the first or second gen. Airpods as well as the Pros; I've been doing just that the last month. When I want to tune out everything around me, I use the Pros. And when I need to hear what's going on around me, and I'm not so fully immersed in what I'm listening to, I use my first gen. Airpods. (The pros have a ""transparent mode"" that allows the listener to hear things going on around them; it works!

"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2020",One person found this helpful,"It seems like the plebs don't understand active noise cancelation. For some reason, the average, work-a-day, degenerate, trough-eating, deplorable, resistance/trump-voting norms don't seem to get that it isn't a magic potion that eliminates all the sound that you don't like at the moment. Teasing aside, all noise cancelation works by detecting sound with a normal, repetitive aural pattern, like an airplane engine or an air conditioner, a lawn mower, etc. It doesn't cancel all outside sound, like voices or other intermittent sound that doesn't conform to a regular, predictable pattern. Given that knowledge, I think these headphones do the best that is physically possible from an IEM headphone. Of course, over-the-ear headphones will insulate more outside sound, but for portable headphones these work in a close to optimal manner. If you are use them right and fit them correctly (some ear types may just not conform, but for most they seem to work well) they have good isolation, noise cancelation, excellent sound, good fit, and the functionality is industry leading, especially when when used with apple devices.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great on all fronts,sonasi

You do pay a premium for that though. The air pod pros sound great and the noise cancelling is really good. My issues are that they have quirks and some quality issues. I think they tried to put too much in such a tiny package and the software is still a little buggy. I had to get a replacement pair after about 2 months because the left air pod stopped working. Also, the integration with the Apple watch has some issues. Using the timer when trying to workout will stop any musing you have playing if your air pods are connected to your phone. If you connect to the watch, then the music will keep playing once you stop the timer alarm. That's just weird. Sometimes when a call comes in and I'm connected to my watch listening to music, only the left air pod will function when I restart playing my music. I have to disconnect and reconnect to the watch to get both to work again.Overall I still like them, but they certainly are not without certain really annoying behavior.

He talked about them for the past month. He started pairing them with the iPhone and reading through the directions and then testing them out and LOVES them. Then as we continued to read through the information about how to charge the ""WIRELESS"" case, it became evident that something was missing from the box. There was a wire, with two different ends, that DO NOT FIT in the iPhone or the IPAD, for the purposes of charging. NOR does this wire fit in any of the 10 APPLE adapters that we own for all of our other apple products. So I got on a chat with Apple Support, since I purchased the extended Apple + Care, to find out if I was actually missing or received the wire item. I rechecked the Amazon listing and although it does not say not included, it does not say that it is included either. But as an Apple user, usually an adapter is included with their products.I found out from the Apple Support person that APPLE NO LONGER PROVIDES ADAPTERS TO ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. He sent me a link to purchase a $49.00 adapter to buy, in addition to what I had already spent on the AirPods Pro, the AppleCare, and now in order to use & charge them, I have to buy yet another adapter.

The AirPod Pro’s will slide and fall out of your ear no matter what size earbud you have on. This is a very common issue for users. If you don’t believe me just google “AirPods falling out”.Most people either have to spend additional money on aftermarket ear buds or some people have luck by turning their AirPods about 30-50 degrees.YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY $200 FOR A PRODUCT THAT DOESN’T FIT WITHOUT SPENDING ADDITIONAL MONEY ON AFTERMARKET PARTS.The headphones fall out even when you are just sitting there doing nothing.Do you want to do any sort of activity (including taking a leisurely stroll)? Expect your AirPods to fall out without warning.“What happens when they do fall?”Well on their first fall from my ears (about 6 feet) inside my house they got multiple dents. This happened the very first time I put them on.My second discrepancy is that they will randomly disconnect or connect to a different device.Example: there have been many occasions where I will be in a zoom meeting on my laptop and all of the sudden they disconnect for absolutely no reason and are stubborn out Reconnecting.Overall: unless money grows on trees or they improve their fit design by increasing the length of the ear bud away from the stem DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Fall out even when you’re not doing anything.,Gary Welch

You may ask yourself “why would he make these crazy sacrifices”? That is because I hate in ear headphones and everything I hated about them Apple fixed. As I stated previously I can not fit AirPods unless I mimic a corpse and sit perfect still but the AirPods Pro fit me PERFECTLY. I absolutely HATE the feeling of something being deep in my ear canal and poking against my eardrums and this is a feeling that most if not every in ear headphone offers. They all offer this EXCEPT the AirPods Pro, somehow and someway Apple made in ear headphones that don’t go in your ear, well at least they don’t feel as if they do because they are super comfortable and don’t offer that ridiculously uncomfortable feeling of something being deep in your ear and knocking on the door of your eardrum. Don’t ask me how they did, but they did it.The next reason why I despise in ear headphones and refused to wear them is because when you put them in and created that seal it’s almost like you can hear your brain working, it creates an almost underwater like feeling, but again somehow, Apple was able to mitigate if not completely eliminate that feeling. The 2 main reasons I can not wear in ear headphones are gone, but that’s not it, there’s more. The sound quality and profile is incredible, these sound WAY better than the OG AirPods and the noise cancellation which I could personally care less about, makes the world disappear right before my ears.

The active noise cancellation is hit or miss. Certain sounds it's fairly good at filtering out, while others seem to pass through completely unhindered. My old Bose noise-cancelling earbuds performed far better across the board.Sound Quality: 4/5 stars. When they're actually seated properly inside your ear (and stay there) they sound fairly good. Certainly not audiophile good (as if they wouldn't turn up their nose at anything wireless in the first place), but better than cheap earbuds.Ease of Use: 0/5 stars. The case can't charge the earbuds with the lid open. The lid cannot be shut with earhooks (necessary for keeping them in your ear) on, requiring they be installed and removed every time you take them on / off. Which will be fairly often with only 3-5 hours of battery life per charge. Speaking of charging, they didn't come with a cable I can actually use to charge the case, so they're having to share the cable for charging my phone.As a final note: I've had one instance of either the active noise cancelling, or the bluetooth connection glitching out and causing a high-pitched and max-volume shrieking sound. Thankfully it only lasted for a moment, but it *was* quite shocking and painful. If it turns out to be a recurring problem then these earbuds will be going straight into the bin where they belong.Overall, the fit for these earbuds is terrible. Apple is the only brand I've ever had this problem of earbuds refusing to stay in. The active noise cancelling is mediocre, and the sound quality is above average.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020",One person found this helpful,"The short review: Although these earbuds sounded good to me and the noise cancellation was good, I'm still returning them. They don't seem to fit properly with either the small or medium ear pieces and they are a bit large in the ear for sleeping, which is one of the main things I wanted them for. I think they'd be great for the vast majority of people, they just didn't suit me.The longer review: I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate music that sounds good. I enjoy using headphones and hearing nuances in the music that I miss when listening on speakers. However, the only time I use headphones are when walking, the occasional airplane trip, and for sleeping. Yes, I'm one of those people who need sounds to sleep. I don't use headphones every night, but when I'm bored with the TV I turn to my music to get sleep.For many years I used a set of cheap wired earbuds that worked fine. The sound was good, they stayed put, and they didn't hurt my ears. But there was no noise cancellation, which was a pain on an airplane and when I wore them to the gym, and the wire meant I had to wear my ipod in a holder on my arm which sometimes caused it to get rubbed by something and change the volume. Not a pleasant thing while trying to sleep. Finally, after more years than could be reasonably expected from a cheap pair of earbuds, they gave up the ghost.Since I got such good results with my original wired earbuds I ordered the exact same thing. The fact that the price had dropped from $15 to $8 should've been a warning sign, but I ordered them anyway. How far wrong can you go for $8? Anyway, it appears the company has changed the way they're making these earbuds and the sound was awful.So I decided it was time to join the 21st century and get a pair of wireless earbuds. Besides, being stuck in the house for several weeks due to COVID meant I was craving a new toy. And I saved a bunch of money by cancelling 2 cruises so the $240 price of these wasn't that bad of a shock. After much research and reading I ended up ordering these AirPod Pros.They arrived quickly and I immediately opened them, paired them to my ipod, and spent a while listening to music while I read a book and my husband had the TV on. The sound quality was really good (remember, I'm not an audiophile and YMMV) and the noise cancellation was unlike anything I'd ever experienced (in a good way!). After a half hour or so my ears started to feel a bit sore so I changed out the default medium-sized earpieces for the smaller ones. The sound quality and noise cancellation wasn't quite as good with those, and I tried shuffling through the various settings (sometimes by accident because the button is easy to hit when you're adjusting the earbuds) and finally got it to where it was acceptable. I only wore them another half hour or so and they felt fine.The big test was when I wore them to bed. It was great to leave the ipod on the nightstand and not worry about having it on my arm where I might accidentally turn up the volume if I roll over. While laying on my back the earbuds didn't feel too bad, but I'm more of a side sleeper. I've been sleeping with earbuds for years and can sleep on my side with one hand cupped over my ear to keep the earbud from smooshing up against the pillow, so I tried the same thing with these. Unfortunately, because the earbuds themselves are larger than wired ones, to accommodate the wireless stuff I guess, I just couldn't lay there without pressing on the earbuds and causing soreness in my ear. I tried for a while and finally took them off.So I'm returning them. The sound quality and noise cancellation are great, but they just never felt that comfortable in my ears and were a bit too big for sleeping. I also don't think the battery would've lasted through the night, but at this point that's a minor detail.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I bought it at $80 discount during black friday plus I already had a $40 gift card, so i only spent half for it. At the price I paid, I'd say it's worth it.Let me compare it to the mpow x3 I got at $60, less than a quarter of airpods pro. In terms of sound quality, they are just the same in terms of clarity & bass. I find the mpow x3 fits my ears better both sitting up or lying down. The airpods pro's touch control (more like squeezing) is more reliable, but mpow x3 touch is not too bad once you get used to it. mpow wins though thanks to the fact that i can change the volume with it. Who wants to call out siri just to increase the volume? that's just dumb. If you like light earbuds, the mpow also wins here.however, airpods pro is very well built. Once you hold it, you feel the premium. I know it's superficial but i can't help it. it is really really nice. The airpods pro also has ANC which I think is pretty good. However, the magic of airpods pro lies in its transparency & spatial audio mode. With the transparency mode, I find myself listening to music/movie while cooking and can still hear my friends talking to me without degrading the music quality at all. It's extremely nice. To really enjoy the spatial audio, you gotta listen to supported video ofc. There are tons on youtube, try it out and you'll feel the magic. And ofc, if you're too deep into the applehole, airpods pro automatically switches between apple devices is quite nice sometimes too.overall, I'd say if you got a good deal then i'd recommend it. But if you only care about listening to music, watching movies, and don't mind manually switch between devices, get something else.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2020",One person found this helpful,"PROS - Battery life is definitely better than original AirPods - Listeners (phone calls & Zoom/Teams calls) report that my sound quality (mic) as good - Sound cancellation works but is not stellar - 3D spatial sound works and is cool but not a big deal IMO - Pairing and sharing with different iPhones and Macs works well, and switching to these as sound source is much faster and more reliable than the get-1 AirPods that I replaced.CONS - Poor Tip Comfort: the rubber tips are not comfortable. I even switched to the small size that came w/ the AP's (as recommended by the fit-test mini-app that is in the iPhone settings), and still ended up being uncomfortable after 20-30 minutes. Solution -- buy a set of aftermarket foam tips. I tried the Comply brand as they seem to have good reviews and they worked. Not cheap at $24, but they solved the problem and improved the noise-cancellation performance a bit. Disappointing that I spent well over $200 for AP's and then had to spend $24 more to make them wearable, but at least there is a solution. - Pod Comfort: Unexpectedly, the body of the pod pressed against the cartridge of my right ear (only) and was quite uncomfortable. However, after continued use + the addition of the foam-ear tips (see above), I got used to it. I don't mean 'put up with it' but the discomfort went away, after about 10 days of use.Overall I'd recommend them. My 'pod comfort' problem seems to be a rare complaint, but the tip comfort complaint pops up in a lot of other online reviews, so be ready to drop added $$ for foam tips, possibly.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Mostly match the good reviews & hype, but are not super comfortable (but got used to them)",Hank G.
"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I was always on the fence about buying these because ear buds like these always tend to fall out of my ears after a short time. So far the only time these have falling out are when I hit my ear from the back or I forget they are in and take my shirt off. The noise cancellation option does work great. It doesn't block everything, but it does bring all the noise down to a very low rumble allowing you to concentrate more on what you need to do. I also tried the option where you can use them as hearing aids. When I say they work great at that is an understatement. I had someone stand about 150 feet away from me and talk in a normal to low voice and heard every word they said. However, when using them as a hearing aid. There is so much constant background noise coming through the air pods that you could only leave them on for a short time while trying to use them as a hearing aid. So you would have to turn this option on every time you needed to use it and off as soon as you are done with it. Otherwise the constant background noise will become very distracting. Also don't try to talk while having them on as a hearing aid. Your own voice gets amplified tremendously. I had to lower the volume before speaking and then turn them back up when trying to listen to the person talking. So I wouldn't really recommend using them for hearing aids unless it was a last resort. The only other problem I don't like about them is the connection via blue tooth between devices. When I want to use them for my laptop. I had to disconnect them from my phone and connect them to my laptop and visa versa when going back to my phone. If there is a way for them automatically switch between devices I haven't learned how to use them like that yet. But if they don't, that is something Apple may want to look into doing. I figure if my $60 plantronics headphones can do it a pair of $220 airpods should be able to do it as well.

There is simply no way there are going to beat a good pair of wired headphones. But even I was surprised by just had bad these were. IF you turn off noise cancellation you could get about 85% of the sound quality of my cheap $9 Hypergear earbuds and 70% of my Bowers & Wilkins C5 Series 2. The active noise cancellation will literally destroy your high end and while EQ could help somewhat it simply can't bring back what is not there.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Back in the day us Boomers used to laugh at ""Italian product design"" meaning designers had put a premium on looks and styling over functionality. This is true of the Airpod line. When they first came out I was excited about the seamless integration with Apple products. Check. That works mostly right most of the time with a couple glaring oversights too. It's the look and functionality. Sleek. Slippery. And everyone in the world has ears that perfectly round pieces of silicon will fit in either small medium or large. Sorry. JUST like the generation 1's these fall out of my ears constantly. Doesn't matter what size silicone tip I wear. I tried all three. They fall out . They fall out. They fall out. I don't have cauliflower ear. I do grapple occasionally but no MMA ears. I have normal ears. Also relying on something jammed in your ear is not a comfortable or reliable way to wear a device that you want to not think about. It hurts after a short time. Why not put a friggin' over ear band to hold them (Like plantronics FIT)? I can wear the Plantronics for 24 hours with no discomfort. I love the functionality. But the wearability is awful---- update after several months of use --- THESE ARE JUNK. You are a fool to spend a dollar on these. The sound is good when they are jammed tight into your ear, but that doesn't last very long, and it's painful. I will NEVER EVER buy junk from this line again. You can't walk across a room without them working themselves loos and falling out. God forbid you need to bend over or take a leak. They'll fall on hard floors or water without any thought to their beautifully packaging and sleek look. My left one fell out yesterday and now it won't hold a charge above 4%... JUNK!!!!

"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I had the original AirPods but didn’t feel compelled to upgrade to the Gen. 2 as the extra hour of battery was kinda meh and the wireless charging I’ve never really been fulled behind. When Apple announced these, I figured there were enough new features in these to justify spending the money to upgrade. Out of the box, the first thing that surprised me was the size. The case is a longer but it feels shorter. I have the Powerbeats Pro as well and that’s always been the scarlet letter on those is the case is HUGE. The AirPods themselves (the stems) are not as long as the previous generation although the AirPod itself is larger. The pairing process was simple enough. You do have to update to iOS 13.2 so that took around 15 minutes or so and just like the original AirPods that card comes up and they pair almost instantly. One of the things I hated on the original AirPods was the handoff time between when you say put an AirPod in and the phone toggles from previous sound source (i.e. car, HomePod) to AirPod or generally just the time it took to connect when you received a phone call. Both are vastly quicker. After putting them in and firing up some music the sound quality is MUCH better than the original AirPods. I paired one headset from the new AirPod Pros and one headset from the Powerbeats Pro and the sound profiles are identical (I would say the Powerbeats are a little more bass-heavy). The soundstage is definitely wider, fuller and louder all-the-way around than the original AirPods. The transparency feature was one I was excited to try. New for this generation, the AirPods have physical buttons that you can press or press and hold facing forward from the stems when they’re in your ear for easier accessibility (its looks and feels much like the Apple Pencil Gen. 2 indented side that was created to give a better grip). This replaces the tapping system that honestly, worked when it wanted to on the first generation AirPods. A press and hold, by default on both headphones, toggles the Noise Cancellation to Transparency Or turns both off (to conserve battery). This can be modified under Bluetooth > AirPod Pros (by tapping the “i”). You can also change one or both of these to be able to activate Siri manually, although these support hands-free Siri which is why all the controls are set to toggle thru the noise preferences instead. The transparency works best when music playback is paused. When music playback is still going on - because of the way these seal, it feels like you’re toggling the noise cancellation between high and low. When playback is paused then you can hear (almost like the Live Listen feature but without having to use the iPhone). Presumably it’s passing audio from the much-pronounced external microphone and amplifying that into the AirPods. The other cool feature located in the Settings for AirPods is the ability to do an Ear Tip Fit Test. Often time, one of the reason these type of headphones (with changeable tips) get poor reviews is because people just use the stock size that comes on them without knowing if they’re truly the best fit or seal (the latter being especially important on noise-cancelling earphones). So there’s a test built in that will play a brief song and use the technology built into the AirPods to determine if you are wearing the right size tips. Nicely done Apple! I have yet to take a call on them so I can’t comment on that, but the call quality was never an issue with the original AirPods. Supposedly with some of the newer headphone chips inside of these the H1 chip is supposed to provide enhanced call quality and performance. Wireless charging included is nice (likely not to use it but at least it’s not something like the Gen. 2 AirPods where that’s exclusively what the price difference is for). The only criticisms I have are (1) the AirPod silicone is white and you’re going to have to clean it often to prevent wax from drying up on it (in other words, colors would’ve been nice) and (2) I wish they added loss and theft to the AppleCare+ plan instead of just accidental damage — especially with the AirPods themselves being physically smaller in size in some regards (the stem primarily). The AirPods now sit in the case inverted or back facing out whereas the previous gens sat with the back flush with the case). Overall, there’s value to be had here from all previous generation owners. Considering these have a lot of first-time features like sweat resistance, transparency mode, noise-cancellation, wireless charging, a customized fit, better audio and call quality, etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Noise Cancellation 🥰🥰🥰,Karthik Shetty
"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020",4 people found this helpful,"I lost my 2nd gen AirPods. I had resisted buy the AirPods Pro, because my AirPods were working fine for the most part. Yes, I sometimes had feed back and a weird sound going from one ear to the next, but I listen to news and books, not music, so it was fine. But, like I said, I lost them. The 'Find My' app said they were in my apartment complex, but I figured they had dropped out of my pocket on my way to my car and someone had picked them up and were enjoying them. After a month of not finding them and looking everywhere I finally accepted they were gone forever and bought the AirPods Pro.Honestly, at first, I wasn't impressed. I really didn't see much difference in the first few hours. I tried the transparency mode and noise canceling mode and it seemed like there was virtually no difference. Oh, well, I thought, I'll keep them a few days and see if they grow on me and if they don't I'll send them back and buy the cheaper 2nd gen again. Then later that day I was listening to them and was going to blow-dry my hair and was about to take them out, because I can never hear a thing when blowing my hair dry with my 2nd get AirPods, but decided to leave them in. I was amazed that I was able to hear clearly! I went back and forth between transparency and noise cancelation and the difference was amazing! It was the same when vacuuming. My car has a fabulous, high end Harman Kardon stereo system, but I actually prefer to keep my AirPods Pro in my ears while driving instead, now.Two days...just two days...after receiving my AirPods Pro I found my 2nd gen AirPods. So, really, I can't afford to keep these. I was happy enough with the 2nd gen AirPods. I should send these AirPod Pros back. But I'm not going to. I can't go back. It's not just the noise cancellation, but the sound quality is just so much better. The fit is awesome, too. I wasn't sure at first, but now I find I have to put my hands to my ears to remember if they are in my ears or not. And they do NOT fall out! They recharge amazingly fast, too.

The button to switch modes is a bit temperamental and you cant use noise cancelling unless you wear both so one issues is I need to get used to the button and the other is by design.

"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I loved the old airpods. They were the best purchase in years. Wish I stuck with just replacing the old model. I got these for only $160 and will still be returning them.The major WTF:In the advertising and apple fan space, these are presented as having many new seemingly great features, but one of the most important and useful features of the old airpods is gone - being able to tap. The control on these new ones is a button. This button can't be tapped, but it has to be squeezed, between two fingers, precisely. Clean, dry fingers. And it is small, and the stem itself is shorter. There goes listening to airpods while doing yard work, or hiking with gloves on, or while cooking and doing the dishes. That is, the majority of my use cases for airpods. Before I could tap with the back of my hand. Heck I could even double-bonk the general side of my head with an open palm and control my airpods. I will be returning and getting the old ones.7 other major beefs [I see no reviewers mentioning these and it feels like apple fan gaslighting...]1) It is weirdly difficult to get these things out of the case, I am pretty dexterous and even when my fingers aren't number it takes a fair amount of fiddling to get these out.2) Transparency mode is only necessary because the new design makes it impossible to hear your surroundings. Even with transparency mode turned on, it doesn't fully restore the awareness of your environment that the old airpods had. So this isn't a feature but a failure to fully address a new bug. If the volume is at half way, I can't hear my wife speaking to me from the other room.3) Believe it or not, these fall out easier. It is simple physics, the head of the uit is about twice as long sticking out of the ear hole. It doesn't rest fully in your ears the way the old ones did. I have worn these for one week and they have fallen out three times. That very rarely happened with the old ones.4) It takes longer to charge the airpods once you put them back in the case.5) My experience is that battery life is functionally much lower. If you press pause on your music, and leave them in for say 30 minutes with no music playing, noise cancellation and or transparency mode are on unless you go out of your way to turn this off each time. Those two functions take battery power.6) The charging cable is useless unless you have the new apple USB C outlet. You can't charge this into a regular usb port (you know, the kind you see in 99% of charging outlets). You'll have to buy a dongle.7) The case lid is more fragile - mine already wobbles after a fall and I have had the thing a week. My old pair have no issues. I think this just comes down the geometry and mass distribution of the new case design.Some pros:1) The bluetooth range seems to be twice as far. I can walk around my whole house and have great reception.2) Noise cancellation is great for when I am in a car (and in a plane, if I am ever in a plane again), walking down a city street where there is traffic noise. I can listen to music in the car now and car sounds are gone, replacing my crummy car stereo. Noise cancellation is a big pro, but on balance, it doesn't make up for the issues above IMO.Minor obscure beef: The whole package is larger and heavier, so if you are a gram-counting ultra light backpacker, know this seems about .3 ounce heavier.If this is your first pair of airpods, expect a 2 year use life.

There's room for other headphones to do better on sound quality, battery life, etc. but Apple made a great set of headphones that puts everything together very well.More details...I watched a lot of YouTube reviews and read a lot of reviews on numerous true wireless headphones. I wanted a set that I could use to make calls in a noisy environment. I finally found a good YouTube video where someone wore several on the corner of a busy street while speaking with the headphones on. The Airpod Pros sounded head and shoulders above the others. I thought it may be bogus because I found little mentioned about this noticeable difference.I finally chose the Airpod Pros and immediately tried them out. My friends and family say my voice is very clear when I'm on a call. I even went so far as driving with the windows open at 40-60mph while on the phone. At those speeds they could hear the wind slightly, but my voice was still very clear. These are what I wanted.Sound quality - they get plenty loud, and sound just fine. These are not $40 cheap headphones. I am sure there are better sounding true wireless headphones though.Noise Cancelling - Everybody raves about how quiet these are, and they're right. They eliminate noise you don't ever realize is there. And they do a good job of canceling lower frequency noise too. The transparent mode isn't perfect, but it's 95%; very nice.Battery life - seems good so far.Case - it's pretty small, so that's nice.Overall, I'm digging these.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Look, I'm not an Apple fanboy by any stretch of the imagination, as a matter of fact I tried to leave the Applesphere by buying a Pixel 4 and a set of Galaxy Buds+. But I'll tell you what, Apple just does it better ( I found that out when I got tired of the Google Assistant and bought an iPhone 11). The Galaxy Buds+ didn't fit very well, the Air Pods do. The Galaxy Buds+ touch controls led to a lot of accidental pauses and skips, the Air Pods don't. The Galaxy Buds+ sound quality wasn't that great for the price, the Air Pods quality is really good for the price. When it comes down to it I was worried about the fit the most, and Im pleased to report the fit is really comfortable and secure. I did a few plyometric workouts (a lot of jumping around) and the Air Pods didn't even come loose much less fall out. The active noise cancellation is super nice, I can sit next to a noisy fan in my hot office and not even hear the fan. The battery life leaves a bit to be desired, only 4.5 hours on continuous play with active noise cancellation on, but that just means I have to charge the Air Pods over lunch, no big deal.These true wireless ear buds are just a better product for iPhone users, I' glad I waited for the Pro version, but I wish I had bought them sooner.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Just a better product,Josh Bort

So, ALL of those amazing noise cancellation, mic transparency functions, and super cool features were completley useless... because these things wouldn't stay in my ear. In fact, to get the benefits of all of those features, these AirPods not only need to be in your ear, they need to be 'firmly' in there and shouldn't come lose.

Have been using ‘classic’ Airpods till now and anticipated a decent uplift in audio quality based on the reviews of the ‘Pros’. Not so much - it is a little better, but not worth the jump. Noise cancelling is so-so. If you are used to either Bose or Sony cans which cancel 80% of the droning noise in an airplane, these get to 30% at best. It is even hard to tell the difference between it being turned on and off. Besides that, they are not as easy to handle and plug in your ears as the 1st and 2nd generation. Not recommended. Hopefully the next generation will be better.Update: 4 months in now, opinion mostly unchanged - the first generation was genius, the second generation a slight improvement. The Pros just don't have that same level of polish. I am still confused every time which ""beep"" indicates whether you are in transparancy mode, normal or noise cancelling. The squeeze technique remains kind of weird. A touch / slide option to adjust the volume would have been the most useful thing they could have added, but didn't. Getting them out of the case remains a bit of a trick (rotate them slightly). If you drop the case, the pods fall out (unlike the original one). It just all feels a little un-Apple and a bit of a rushed product. When switching to the normal ones (when the battery of these things is empty again), I am always amazed how ""airy"" they feel in your ears, compared to the Pros that plug in your ear canal.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"High expectations, disappointed after a few weeks of use.",BAS VAN DEN BERG

You know, the ones with the rubber tips that you stuff into your ear canals. They normally make me feel uneasy and cause me headaches. As a result, I've decided to stick with the classic EarPods and AirPods style.It wasn't easy to make the decision to buy AirPods Pro. It goes against all of my earphone convictions and expectations. Apple, on the other hand, deserves praise because this is now my primary listening system (previously an AirPods 2nd gen user). Because of the build-up of pressure in the ear canal, I discovered that in-ear style buds cause me discomfort. The AirPods Pro have vents that control the pressure inside your ear, making them feel almost as inconspicuous as the normal AirPods. I can wear these for hours until the battery runs out, while the standard AirPods hurt after around an hour.By keeping the AirPods stem, you can easily switch between transparency and noise cancellation modes. I normally keep mine on Transparency mode, but switching to noise cancellation mode when my surroundings are too noisy is cool. FYI, the AirPods Pro come with a range of ear tips, so you'll most likely find one that suits your ear canal perfectly.I bought this on sale for under $300 CAD at the time of writing this article. Another factor this is a good buy is Apple's ability to make their goods work so well together.

We have several iPads, a Mac Book. All 6 phones on my contract are the latest of iPhone models and we also have 2 pair of AirPod Pros. I bought my wife the first set and she just absolutely raved about them. The sound quality. Battery life and all that is Apple. So I ordered me a set and before I go off on this little tear, I just want to reiterate that my family is Apple through and through. I am a truck driver and the only headset I ever sported is a Blue Parrot B450-XT. The headset is bulky, heavy on one side , the range is t that great and if you wear it long enough you’re ear will start to feel like someone hit you upside the head with a 2x12. That being said..,the ABSOLUTE BEST THING about this headset is the noise canceling ability. I could stand out by my truck getting fuel at a truck stop with not only my hood up and engine running but multiple other trucks at the fuel stop fueling their trucks with the engines running and some with their hoods up. My point is...the people that I were in the phone with had ABSOLUTELY no idea what I was in the middle of a slew of running trucks fueling as I was because the noise cancellation is SO GOOD on this unit. However, as I said before, this unit is bulky, heavy and puts quite a bit of pressure on your ear the longer you wear it. I have 7” straight stacks and they are loud and the one on the driver side of my truck is no more than 14” away from my head so my ears get a workout and one last time...the B450-XT’s noise canceling ability is second to none!Now..back to my love of all things Apple. I absolutely love these AirPod Pros....with the exception of the noise canceling ability. They are so versatile and very comfortable to wear. You could literally wear them all day and not miss out on anything going on around you with the Transparency mode. It absolutely pains me that I can’t wear them as much as I would like but if I am in my truck driving down the road the people I am talking to tell me that it is so loud and there is so much background noise during our conversation. Even if I am just idling my truck sitting somewhere the people I am on the phone with complain about the background noise and they aren’t the only side to complain...if I am not driving and just sitting with my truck idling their voices cut in and out as if I was dipping in and out of cell service.There you have it...I am still an Apple guy and my family is still an Apple family and these AirPod Pros are still an amazing accessory to have..if you are t a truck driver with a set of straight pipes.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great Apple accessory BUT..,.",Allen

"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"The Airpods Pro are IMO definitely worth upgrading to from the original airpods. Using a seal the pro is able to produce much better lower frequencies. You also don't really feel the soreness or pressure some earbuds can cause. ANC and transparency mode really make them feel like they're in a completely different class. I'm not a fan of the lightning charging port, but they at least include a lightning to usb cable (not cheap) and wireless charging.My main concern is with the battery. 4.5 hours is more than enough for continuous play, and the fast charging is pretty incredible (3 hour recharge in 15 minutes). However 4.5 hours is one of the worst in its class, and doesn't leave much room for battery degredation. Relying on aggressive fast charging gives me serious concerns over the product's longevity. I wouldn't be surprised if these need replacing in 2-3 years. This is really the only reason I can't give them a 5Competition (sony wf-1000xm3)There's not a lot of competition IMO, however the sony's really hold their own. The sony's are much larger and heavier, yet still somehow seem to maintain a very comfortable fit. The case on the sony's is enormous and certainly not pocketable. The sony's case does get a usb-c port, but is missing wireless charging. They don't have good waterproofing for exercising, and their size makes them a bit awkward for that anyways.That being said they're often as much as $50 cheaper than the airpod pros, but get 6 hours per charge, and sound equally good (if not better). Noise cancelling is probably slightly better on the sony's and the added bass is better for genres like hip hop or EDM. If you're only going to use them at the office (instead of for travel or exercising) I'd actually recommend the sony's. They're cheaper, sound better (to me) and don't have battery issues.

The Bose case is way too large and has battery capacity that I personally would never get to use even half between wall charges. The Galaxybuds case is about the same size but much thicker.The active noise cancelling does give me a headache when no sound is being played, so I have to either keep music playing or take them off between conference calls. Not much of an issue for me, just something to keep in mind.The fit of the earbuds is comfortable, and the stem has been designed to be shorter than the Airpods, which I personally think is an improvement.The connection to my samsung S10+ has been seamless, installed the MaterialPods app and I can see the battery percentages similar to iOS.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2020",One person found this helpful,"After having owned the original AirPods and absolutely loving them, these were a profound disappointment. I’ll be honest, at first they seemed like a resounding improvement, both with sound quality, and functionality. Needless to say I’m back to using my old ones which still work great. The first generation was avant guard. I know they didn’t work properly with everyone’s ear archetype, but even when they felt they may fall out, they never did. The next generation although ostensibly brandishing new features (noise cancelation), would constantly fall out of my ear. What’s atrocious is the communication with the iPhone. I found myself constantly pressing “forget device” and paring them back up so when opened, it would display the battery level. Toward the end of their ephemeral life ( yes they just don’t work anymore after only 8 months) they were wheezing and people could not hear me clearly. The last glitch before they became feckless was their inability to charge in sync. I can’t share how many times the next day I would plug them in my ear right before a workout and I would hear the deathly twinkle sound that the right ear bud was imminently about to die. My guess is Apple needed something new, threw in some noise cancelation feature, and redesigned them because that’s how they make money. I have owned apple products since before they were cool, and I always thought they would never sacrifice quality for flash and speed, but these air buds confound that sentiment. No way should close to $200 ear buds be rendered useless in 8 months, that’s just a swindle.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Breathtakingly disappointing,Andres Echevarriarza

"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2021",One person found this helpful,"I read and did a lot of research prior to ordering. I was so nervous to unbox the AirPods because of all the speculation around them being fake from Amazon. Happy to tell you all, they’re real. At least mine are. I looked up the serial number on the box on the apple “check your service and support coverage” page and they are 100% authentic (Amazon is also an authorized reseller of Apple products). I even dug deeper and looked at an article on how to spot fake and real AirPods. The ones I got from Amazon ticked all the boxes of authentic pods.The noise cancellation is pretty cool. It blocks out light noises like a fan or air conditioner. It doesn’t completely shut out loud talking or a lawn mower for example.I’m not a huge audiophile but I can say the bass is just ok. It doesn’t sound much different than my wired Bluetooth Sony headphones but they’re still really good. Sound quality overall though is great.Transparency mode is also really cool. You can hear everything around you and have normal conversations while still being able to listen to music. Talking on the phone is also really easy and sounds natural.The coolest part for me though is that they conform to your ears and they have vents to relieve pressure so they’re more comfortable. And they do not fall out of my ears. Ever. I have quite small, waxy ears and every other pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned (which has been a lot) have always fallen out of my ears. Chewing, walking, turning my head, even staying still they’d fall out. These don’t. They’re bomb lol.Battery life is ok too. Could be a lot better. They connect so fast to my phone and as soon as you open the lid, the charge percentage shows up (and they charge really fast) but you have to have the pods in the case to be able to see exactly how much charge is left in the case and both buds.After all is said and done though, I love these. They’re the coolest, most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever had. They’re pretty pricey but in my opinion, worth it. Go get you some AirPod Pros!!

I am an audio engineer, and by extension, a bit of an audiophile. Since I need to be able to hear everything in the songs and sounds I'm working on, I have developed high standards, especially since I use high end studio grade headphones and I have grown accustomed to them. All of that being said, my daily driver on my PC is the DT770 Pro. I absolutely love the sound, but I wanted headphones that delivered similar sound quality while away from the computer.That's where the Apple AirProds Pro comes in. These headphones sound VERY close to the DT770 Pro, and those headphones are an order of magnitude larger than the AirPods Pro, so you could I was very shocked to hear this level of sound quality in such a small package. Very flat EQ. Slightly lacking in bass, but it is easily made up for with it's Noise cancelation. The noise cancelation on these headphones are pristine! I take the train a lot for commute, and these headphones drown it all out. Now, of course, it doesn't drown EVERYTHING away, but play a song and you absolutely wont notice any noise you may hear otherwise. The size of the case and headphones are so conveniently small and it fits virtually anywhere! The headphones are also extremely lightweight and comfortable. They have a nice grip on the ears yet feel light as a feather and you forget you have them on sometimes. Despite it's light weight, it's a tank. I have accidently dropped them from head level sometimes and they haven't been affected by it at all. A neat bonus to it all is spatial sound which makes supported videos more immersive! The only real complaint here is with the battery life. If you wanted to use these for work, they wont even last long enough for a part timer. Most of this is due to the active noise cancelation. However, the upside is that the case will fully charge the headphones in about 15 minutes!Overall, I have fallen in love with these headphones.

The sound quality is the best I’ve heard from earbud style headphones and the battery life is as advertised (~5 hours depending on volume and ANC). These things also hold very well in my ears and I don’t have an issue with them falling out. My biggest complaint comes from the active noise cancellation feature. I live in a rural area where essentially all the noise in my bedroom comes from an air purifier. The ANC feature significantly reduces the noise of the air purifier compared to passive mode, but it doesn’t reduce it to the point where I’m impressed for the price. I’ve seen complaints about the current firmware reducing the effectiveness of ANC (these ones shipped with the most recent firmware installed and there’s no way to revert to the old firmware apparently). If that’s the case, then I hope Apple will crank the ANC capabilities back up in a future firmware update because these would then be an unbeatable pair of wireless earbuds.

The sound quality is that of any other headphone I’ve ever had. So why pay so much more. All the features this does is absolutely amazing. Paired easily there was no White noise entering. However my $30 ones did the exact same thing. The only thing I did not do of course with all the Apple functions. I didn’t mind losing my $40 pair I think I would mind a lot if I lost these knowing that they were so expensive and they didn’t even sound better than my $40 pair. I understand why a lot of people will want these it’s simply not me. Really think about it. You can get just as good sounding earbuds from a lot of other companies. I sent these back.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2020",7 people found this helpful,"These headphones are a game changer for working from home during COVID-19! I bought them because I have three shared, thin walls in my apartment that result in significant background noise from neighbors (i.e. stomping, thuds, talking, cabinets/doors slamming, kitchen sounds, etc.). The regular AirPods and my Taotronics over-the-ear active noise cancelling headphones I have didn’t make a significant difference in reducing sound. However, the noise cancelling feature in the AirPods Pro drowns out neighborly noise to allow me to focus during the work day. These headphones are especially useful for tuning in to video conferences and phone calls without disruptive background noise. I also love the AirPods Pro for listening to podcasts, music, and guided meditations to unwind. On Fourth of July, I was impressed that these headphones cancelled out most of the loud noise from fireworks throughout the neighborhood.Note that the AirPods Pro don’t cancel all noise, but about 70% of it. I can still hear high-pitched sounds (birds chirping, a neighbor turning on a squeaky faucet, etc) — albeit at a lesser volume — when using the noise cancelling feature without listening to music. Utilizing noise cancelling with music playing tends to block the most sounds.Additionally, I recharge these headphones during the lunch hour since the batteries only last about four hours.Overall, I highly recommend the AirPods Pro to maintain sanity during the quarantine!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Silences Neighborly Noise,JustMe

While sound is good, it seems that is only thing Apple focused and tested. Here's what I've discovered over the past few months of daily use:* The noise cancellation is okay -- it certainly helps. But it causes ear pain due to a very high pitch when not when there is not audio playing through, and it certainly doesn't silence the outside environment completely.* I have AirPods too. I never had people tell me when using my AirPods they could not hear me. With the AirPods Pro, I would say more than half of the calls, people cannot hear me clearly. The microphone seems to be garbage -- people say I sound like I am underwater.* Often, I'll start a call on my iPhone X without using the AirPods Pro. If the conversation needs to become private, I'll then put them in my ears. The time it takes for the iPhone to transfer the call is long -- long enough that the person on the other end cannot hear anything, even background noise, thinks they lost me, and then hangs up.

I bought a dual charger and can charge my phone and AirPods at the same time overnight while I sleep and have them fresh for the day's work.3.

With any other headset (JBL,Jabra) it seemed as if I could run a full 8 hours of work with no problem or charging needed. With AirPod Pro's, I can only go half a shift, maybe slightly a little longer if I don't use Noise Cancelling, which is not a sacrifice you want to have to make.Overall, these AirPod Pro's are good, but they could be really exceptional if they fixed these few items regarding volume control and battery life.

If you want battery life info, program Google Assistant, and music auto-pause if removed from ear, you will have to install a 3rd party app. I'm using MaterialPods, which costs about $1.50. With that app, you basically have all the controls that Apple users have.The only issue is that you can only toggle between ANC and pass-through. You cannot turn both off fully. You also cannot update the Airpods Pro. You will need to connect them to an iPhone and leave them connected overnight to update them. There is no force update option...you have to leave them connected overnight. Mine came with version 2D15, while the latest is 2D27. Apple made some changes to the ANC, so this update is necessary. Hopefully, they are now shipping with the latest version.Audio quality/fit: Highly subjective. I like the way they sound. If they don't fit correctly there are already thousands of third party tips to address your concerns.Other things that Apple just got right:- Force touch controls. The trigger area is bigger than a button but not as finicky as touch.- Call/microphone quality: Pretty much class leading.

Even the Galaxy Buds Plus connected to my Samsung S9+ never accomplished this feat.Conclusion: I really wish Apple would offer a first party app for Android users because the Airpods Pro are a truly exceptional product.

I apologize in advance if this is all over the place. I tend to jump around. So. Keep up.I am mainly writing this review to touch on some of the questions I had prior to purchase that I could not find a sufficient answer to.First: The sound quality is fantastic. I had the AirPods V1 (until I lost them) and purchased these hoping to upgrade in every aspect. Sound quality is much much better then V1.Second: Noise cancellation, it works. Quite well I might add. It’s not completely silent. You wolnt sit here and listen to the voices in your head only. Prior to purchase the main question I had was about using them on a lawn mower. When noice cancelation is turned on and you start mowing, you can still hear whatever you are listening to. I was listening to a podcast on almost 3/4 volume and had to turn it down at times. You can still hear the mower bog down and Slight engine noise if you try. So you can mow without issue hearing what’s going on while listening to medium volume media.Third: “transparency mode” I have never had any device with this before so I am pleasantly surprised. When turned on the outside world is slightly louder but you can function normally I life and hear everything perfect.Forth: the pods stay in your ears... very well. The first test I did when I put these in was the shake test. I did as much shaking of my head until my peanut between my ears had bounced off the walls of my skull enough to give me a headache.... and the AirPods did not move one bit. That’s a successful test.. minus the headache.Fifth: they are quite comfy. Leave them in all day and not have any “tight” feeling in your ears.In summary: I cannot recommend these enough.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020",One person found this helpful,"The sound quality is perfect if you’re not an audiophile! The noise cancellation is more of a noise minimization which isn’t a bad thing seeing how small and useful these things are. The cancellation works best with background noise better than it would with someone next to you talking to you or something falling and hitting the floor near you. The transparency is great and such a useful feature but if you have your music loud enough you might as well turn it off, you also don’t get crystal clear transparency but for the size and convenience of these it’s understandable and actually kind of impressive that it’s as good as it is, it’s just not as clear or refined as other over the ear headphones that do it better. They’re great so far and I love having them but I have had some glitches with them that didn’t last more than a day so luckily that didn’t ruin the product for me and never happened again. These are also pretty durable, if you aren’t being reckless with them they last you a while and will stay in pretty good shape, I’ve dropped them a few times and on the worst of those they were only scratched a bit, lucky it isn’t noticeable and doesn’t effect my listening at all. Something to note would be if you haven’t used true wireless earbuds before these might make your ears hurt a bit but that’s only because you aren’t used to holding these things up in your ear and it’ll stop bothering you in a week or two which at the time annoyed me but now that I’m used to them I love using them, and for people with waxy ears these might be a bit tedious for you while people that have super waxy ears I would suggest thinking twice about getting these because AirPods falling out of your ears constantly might ruin the convenience they offer. But the thing about AirPods Pro that makes them so great is all the little problems they fix when compared to other earbuds/headphones.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2021",2 people found this helpful,"I got what I paid for.These wireless earbuds are of great sound quality. Everything is very balanced and you can hear everything within any songs you may listen to. As someone who likes a decent amount of base, the balance is great and while it is, on paper, quieter than the mids and highs, I can still hear it perfectly fine and in a prominent fashion, all while not completely dominating the song (I’m talking to you raycon - take a hint).The soundstage isn’t really there, but since these are in-ears I’m frankly okay with that. You can only really get true soundstage from decent headphones, after all. Regardless, as in ear wireless earbuds go, these are a great product. The noise-cancellation and ergonomics are great, although they do tend to start to fall out after a while due to a combination of moisture and earwax, but using the large eartips helped make that less of a problem. These are far more comfortable than conventional earbuds and I wish more companies would make their ergonomics closer to what these use.The transparency mode takes some getting used to, but only because sometimes I find myself forgetting the earbuds are even in my ears, along with the fact that it’s not using the most sensitive microphones in the world, so your surroundings will be heard, but definitely a tad quieter than if you weren’t wearing these at all, so keep that in mind when considering these for use at work or anywhere else where you may need to hear your surroundings. The transparency mode only tends to cause issues when someone is calling out from farther away, where you may be able to recognize your name, but not much else due to the quieter sound being played into your ears.Either way, any complaints are minor and very insignificant for the most part, and I do believe these are worth the money.As someone who’s now tested it both with and without an iPhone (I recently switched from android after having the earbuds for a few weeks) I didn’t notice a significant difference in sound quality, so if you don’t care about the quality of life features, then you should be fine getting this to use with an android device.If you do care about the quality of life features then read the following:Many features such as enabling or disabling the noice cancellation/transparency completely or the special audio are lost, along with automatic pausing when you remove an earbud.There are apps to regain some of these features, the best one that I’ve found is called Assistant Trigger, but the features then get buggy and annoyingly unresponsive at times. I’ve found that the automatic pausing can mess with your music randomly pausing when using it on android. Otherwise, most features can be retained, albeit with lower quality.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for decent sounding and comfortable earbuds. These are of great value when you consider just how expensive that good in-ear monitors can cost (the best of the best can cost as much as $2000).Five stars all the way.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great value when you consider the alternatives.,Dominic M.

Though various youtubers were mixed and the audiophiles of course said they work fine for what they are and weren't the best. They fit fine in my ear with medium tips. After 1 month of lite use as in just a few hours or more a week on average it does a good job. just don't expect to be blown away and its all subjective.

Elite 75t sounded like you where listening to amplification through an old radio, and were horrible in the wind. The passive noise reduction is about the same. And the active noise reduction which Jabra doesn't have is amazing. Tested it with the microwave vent first. For 3 out of the 4 settings, I could barely tell it was running. Interestingly eneough it was on setting 3 that I could hear it (must be a frequency thing). Today I tried them on the lawn tractor. You could definately hear it, but could also hear my podcast at 50% instead of 80-100%. The fit is good and they don't fall out.

I run on weekends and they never fall out.The audio quality is crazy good. Not audiophile good, but not too shabby. The bass is deep and present. The dynamic audio between the two buds creates an insane depth of illusion where I sometimes truly cannot tell if the music I’m listening to is from the AirPod Pros or something around me. They can get quite loud, and if you have noise cancellation on you can get really loud without ever going over half volume (it’s harder to “hear” the volume when ambient environment noises conflict, thus requiring you to turn your volume up louder without noise cancellation)The noise cancellation if you’ve never experienced it before is startlingly good. If you have experienced noise canceling before, it’s startlingly good! I commute via public bus daily and usually sit next to the engine in the back. The AirPods pros can’t manage to mask the engine’s entire hum purely by noise cancellation, but if you have music playing you will forget the engine is even there.The battery for most people will not be an issue given that you put them in the case intermittently.Now I use the AirPod pros mainly with new apple products but also have used them with android. Simply put, the connectivity is much more fluid with an apple product. The H1 chip and Bluetooth v5 on the AirPods and device make for a much better experience than I anticipated. The only issue I have is that when taking one AirPod out (this is supposed to stop audio) it will stop but then flicker the audio between on and off. This isn’t really a big con but just to say that the connectivity is not flawless.The price is the only real con here, but if you want in-ear true wireless noise canceling buds then there’s little to compete with these in the market.

For $250, you expect good sound quality and overall battery life.Definite check on battery life but sound quality is only okay. If you're spending $250, you might as well shell out an additional $50 to get a pair of **Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2**. They're worth it for the price unlike these AirPods Pro.I'm not saying it's a terrible purchase but the price tag for this quality isn't right.As some of you have taken Economics, you'd know that any product's price is determined by how much people are willing to pay for such item. This goes true for almost everything. Apple in general sells products at extremely marked up price nearly 2-5x more than the production cost. Of course majority of this profit doesn't go back into the company for R&D, it's mainly goes into their pockets.The noise cancellation is great, I've even tested this while riding at certain speeds with from 25mph to 85mph. The wind becomes audible around 60-65mph. Of course going faster, the wind gets louder but it's actually not bad at all.Aesthetically, they're smaller than the 1st gen which is good as I can keep it hidden and safely wear it with my full face helmet.Overall, for $250 these are overly priced, if it somehow was marketed around $160-$200, the price would definitely be worth but not for $250.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2020",One person found this helpful,"These earbuds are fantastic. The noise cancelling is top notch, and the sound quality (while noise cancelling is on) is pretty good. However, because the earbuds are only held in by the actual buds themselves with no wing or anything else to support them, they can fall out while running or working out, but that's really the only time that becomes a problem.In terms of comfort, you get to choose between three sets of rubber tips, and if those don't fit you'll probably have to buy aftermarket stuff, but I doubt that would be too common of a problem. They stay in my ears while I'm not doing anything too active, and they only start to be a little uncomfortable after the first few hours wearing them.Battery life is pretty good too. I've been wearing them for school, which included a language program that lasted 5 hours a day (with some short breaks every hour) and they held up fine. You just have to make sure that if you're not actively using them you put them back in the case to have them get some charge back, because the battery is small.Overall, I'd say they're worth it.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I didn’t like the original AirPods mainly because it wouldn’t stay in my ears and the annoyingly long stem. With the Pro, not only did Apple fix both of these issues by using adjustable ear tip sizes and shrinking the stem, but added noise cancellation as well. I found the small ear tips to fit me perfectly and haven’t had an issue with them falling out. Audio quality has also improved from the original, most notably was that I could actually hear and feel the bass very well. Noise cancellation makes your music sound feel more immersive. However, you have to really secure these things for noise cancellation to work at it’s best. This has become a bit of an inconvenience as they occasionally loosen up while I’m exercising.There are also sweat resistant which makes them more ideal to bring to the gym. And of course, automatically pair and turn on/off with your iOS device.Overall, AirPods Pro is worth the extra cost mainly for the noise cancellation and adjustable tips.

The regular iPhone ear buds never have stayed in my eat so I was glad when the gel ends came with them and I haven’t had them drop yet and it’s been a week or so. Super excited 🙌🏽,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Pleasantly surprised 😊,Animated31
"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Exactly one month after the return window closed it is no longer pairing, resetting and it is pretty much dead weight. Sound quality was ok, noise canceling good, battery bad as it degraded significantly in one month use and wouldn’t last 3 hours. Shouldn’t cost more than $40 for what it is. Ear tip is uncomfortable at best, aftermarket foam tips make it bearable.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Skip this overpriced plastic toy.,Shadow133

I like Apple products but the prices...smh.Other ear buds were good at first and then went bad pretty quick. Pairing poorly and sound not too great.I broke down and paid the price for these. Now, I freaking love these things.The noise cancellation is on point and the sound quality is great. I also love the ease in pairing and the pause-pickup when taking in and out of ear. I can use one, then the other if I need them for a long timespan.You got me good.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,You Got Me,TJ
"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020",One person found this helpful,"Very easy to use and comfortable fit. Not likely to fall out. Noise cancelling is effective and has an option to allow ambient noise for when you don't want noise cancelling. Battery life is more for occasional phone calls or other short intervals. I use them for class and charge in between. Expensive, so I'm sure there are other options that work just as well.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Comfortable and easy to use,Andie
"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2021",3 people found this helpful,"I’m a strong believer that wired headphones will always be better than wireless. I mean, you are quite literally sacrificing quality for convenience. So, picking up the AirPods Pro, I expected to be neutral at best. Fast forward a couple months, it’s literally all I use with my iPhone. Wired still sounds better and has a much better microphone (The AirPods microphone is complete garbage), but the convenience factor is a lot more important than I anticipated. It’s just SO easy to throw them in and out.Noise cancelling isn’t anything too great but the battery life is solid and they’re pretty comfortable. Definitely some downsides but it’s just so convenient. No cable occupying the charging port or getting caught on door handles. There is no reason not to have a pair if you own an iPhone.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,AirPods Pro vs Wired,Ryan
"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020",One person found this helpful,I've tried all the rest but Apple continues to be the best.... the sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing. I don't like to where them to work out for fear they might fall out so my wife bought me a cheap pair of knock offs and they just don't compare. The battery in the apple AirPods is also fantastic. Apple products are getting better and better.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The Best Ear Pods,BI Smith
"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I spent $200 to for AirPods, looking for a more integrated Apple solution for Bluetooth ear piece connectivity. I've used Plantronics with my iPhone for years and it works quite well, AirPods on the other hand, can maintain connectivity through often a single call. I see various troubleshooting steps on line, but for $200 I don't feel like I should having to troubleshoot a Bluetooth connection between two Apple devices. AirPod reliability is exceptionally disappointing.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Does not maintain connection with my iphones,Sue
"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021",One person found this helpful,I hate the fit. HATE. And I am an apple lover. I have never been dissatisfied with an apple product until these. I like the normal air pods much better. The noise cancellation is really nice when you want it. Sounds quality is amazing. But they fall out of my ear when talking (or singing). Very not happy with these. I’ve had my entire family try them and no one has said they would buy the pro.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Good for sound quality, noise cancellation HORRIBLE fit",DECARROLL

"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021",One person found this helpful,"The right side AirPod does not charge. I have to finagle with it to get it to connect to the charger inside the case. Once it shows me that it is charging, I walk away and let it “hopefully” charge but it never does!!!! Somehow it disconnects on the right AirPod and never charges. Then I always have one fully charged and one with like 2% and it doesn’t work. I have tried everything. I am so disappointed and frustrated.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Doesn’t charge or connect,Erica
"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I like the Pros, I will say I think the sound quality compared to other brands in this price point is a bit shallow, the highs bottom out with a bit of a tinny structure. However the bass is smooth and not overblown to make me turn them down. They are super convenient, pair easily, battery holds longer than expected including cross country flights. For conference calls they are a contender, but not as good as hard mic line.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"AirPods Pro are comfortable; battery is A+, sound holds it own",Kimberly Hageman

Whether it be sennheiser momentum, JBLs, AKGs, Bose, the origional AirPods and beats. I really disliked all of them. But these AirPods pro hit the perfect point. They’re comfortable, they fit properly, they have excellent noise cancellation and pass through; and to top it all off the sound quality is very good. This device hits all of the right spots. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Worth the investment,William J.
"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020",4 people found this helpful,"These are the best headphones I have ever used. The sound is beautiful, the fit is perfect. I literally just got these out the box and I fell in love! These headphones are suitable for sports enthusiasts. Airpods Pro has a new anti-sweat function, so you don't have to worry about sweat damaging the headphones during exercise. For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. The battery is very impressive, but the noise reduction function may consume more power.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Best wireless headphones on the market!,Mary Spencer
"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2020",5 people found this helpful,I expected better sound quality at least .. The sound quality reminds me of them 99cent earphones.. even $30-50$ generic Bluetooth earphone sounds better.. I’m only keeping this because generics one I bought one side keeps dying so I’m hoping by paying the extra cash for quality it’ll last a whole lot longer.. the noise cancellation was amazing.. i opened then placed in my ear and boom quiet.. I wasn’t even connect to Bluetooth and that threw me off the noise canceling is 5 star.. what kills me the most is the sound quality.. $200 for some bad sound quality awesome noise canceling Bluetooth earphone lolBeen using it for couple months and one thing I hate about it is that there’s no on on/off button and it’s constantly still on which if I don’t use it for a while/charge it I come back to some dead EarPods.. it shouldn’t be worth $200,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,the noise canceling cause that’s about the only thing I like about the AirPods Pro,John

"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020",2 people found this helpful,"I want to love these so much. I did love these, actually- for almost a month I’ve been using them daily - they’re incredible for the gym because I can phase out the sound of everything around me. They rocked, until the other day when I popped them in and one of the airpods was completely dead. I tried to see the battery level on my phone and couldn’t get my phone to pop the info up- had to add battery life to my widgets just to see that my R bud was 0%, and the case and L bud were 100%. I thought maybe I didn’t have them in the case correctly so I took them out, put them back in, and a little while later my L bud was now 1% and the R was 100%. It made no sense but it completely ruined my workout. I unpaired and paired, I left case plugged in- I did every trouble shooting method I could think of but nothing’s working. Returning these for a replacement (which Amazon says will take weeks to come in 😡) and if that doesn’t work I’m going to buy directly from Apple and see if that makes a difference. I hope the new pair comes quick and works well- because everything about them before this issue began was amazing. I’ll update when I receive the new pair.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Battery issues, but sound incredible. Hoping just a fluke and new pair will be better!",Julie Tournas

"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020",One person found this helpful,"I keeps on falling out. The ear fit test is useless in long-term. Noise cancellation is not that great since the noise can still come through. Spatial audio is only available for shows on Apple TV + which makes spatial audio useless on Netflix, Amazon prime video, etc. Mostly really hard to find the perfect ear tip. The wired earphones fit better!

"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020",One person found this helpful,I use them mostly for listing to audiobooks and classical & jazz music while walking and running. They are great for blocking street noise. It takes a bit of trial and error to get the earpieces sized correctly for a tight fit and you will find that using the noise cancellation and tight fit will make them somewhat uncomfortable after 3-4 hours.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Excellent wireless, noise cancelling earbuds",ultragolden
