Hyatt,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2018","This was sent to me twice: The first time I received an empty case and the second one appeared to be a returned item, as surely no company would sell such a filthy item. There was so much particulate matter on both sides of the filter that I was dumbfounded. I had also ordered an Amazon Basic UV filter for a larger lens so that I could compare them in action. The Amazon Basic looked like it came from a ""clean room"" - as well it should. I was pleased at how flawless it was. I opened the Tiffen moments later, and was shocked and truly disappointed. I got to work with my cleaning kit and after several minutes was so disgusted (it actually looked as if the dust was embedded in the lens), I simply returned it. So here's my thoughts on these filters: The case was not sealed, so the filter could easily fall out and become lost or dirty.

37 people found this helpful,Amazon Junkie,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2016","The idea that these are used as ""UV filters"" is outdated. That was the case with film, adding this filter increased clarity by filtering some wavelengths found in haze and glare that were enhanced by film, but that is apparently not an issue with digital. These are really protection for the front element of your lens, but that comes at a cost. Every piece of glass you make the light pass through degrades the image to some degree.I own a few of these, I use them on lenses attached to my digital SLRs when I'm walking around doing tourist stuff and taking snapshots, the benefit of protection out in the world outweighs any image degradation for me. For inside/ studio use, these come off. I also use them on my Mamiya RZ lenses for shooting film outside for the haze filtering abilities stated above.

One person found this helpful,Jay Pinks,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2019","I do not use these for the UV filter but as a good quality, low cost lens protector. That said:My 1st Tiffen was a 55mm UV Protector I got for the kit lens that came with a Sony a7ii; an FE 28-70. I was so happy with the purchase that I have since purchased three additional Tiffen UV Protection Filters. One is on a Sony E 55-210 I bought used and one is on a Samyang 35mm I bought new. The one I am writing this review for I assume is still on the Sony FE 50mm I bought new but returned and forgot to remove the filter.The point? I treat my lenses, new or used, like I treat a cell phone. That being the phone stays in the box until I have a protective case for them and lenses stay in the box until I have a protective filter to pair them with. And the one I forgot to remove from the returned lens? That is how confident in the Tiffen filters I am. Once I put one on a lens, I never need to think about it again.I have used several brands in several sizes ranging from the cheaper Altura and Polaroid to the mid range Hoya and B & W.Where does Tiffen fit? Well they are no Hoya or B & W but I am no professional photographer. I am an amateur who mostly enjoys street photography when I travel and for my money Tiffen is the best. Yes, you can spend more and get better glass and if you really have reason to worry about ghosting you should look for a higher end lens. That isn't me saying ghosting has been a problem for me. I normally use a lens hood and I think that helps cut down on light reflection. I have noticed some minor issues with it on some shots I have taken in direct bright light conditions but not enough to justify the higher price.I do not stack filters as I haven't had a need to so I can not give an opinion on that topic. I would assume that the risk of ghosting would increase.The short version is this. The Tiffen UV Protection Filter is well made with good quality glass and a metal ring with threading I do not worry will cross thread or strip. They do what I need by protecting my lens. If I was buying a ND or polarizers I might buy a more costly brand but for everyday protection, Tiffen is all I need and the best for my money.Tiffen say it best in their own product description; A small price to pay to protect your investment.",Low Price for Peace of Mind,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase

Anderson,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2018","After learning more about photography, I’ve come to the conclusion that UV filters are unnecessary and potentially hurt your photos with added chance of lens flare, especially if you plan on stacking a polarizer or ND on top of it. Unless you expect mud or sand flying at your lens, you don’t need to put a $10 piece of glass in front of a lens costing hundreds or thousands of dollars, for the same reason you avoid taking photos through your windshield. If you want accidental impact protection, get a lens hood.That said, I can’t complain about the quality. The build is as expected, thin aluminum with good threads. The glass is flawless, and I haven’t noticed any added vignettes or aberrations. Tiffen makes a quality product. I bought their CPL and variable ND after a great deal of research, and I couldn’t be happier.The first filter I received had a minor scratch near an edge and small flecks embedded in the glass.

It was my second day out with a DSLR and was about to just wipe the sand off the lens with my shirt and lucky for me someone stopped me. Sand will scratch the glass. They then told me to buy some a couple UV filters for harsh conditions like this, if it gets ruined it is only a few bucks vs couple hundred or more for a lens.So I took his advice and bought these. Now outdoors in bright sunlight taking pictures of animals and cars.. the pics come out good as far as I can tell. But in low light indoors with things like candles, small lamps, etc.. there is lots of ghosting and i guess what could be called haze.So if you need cheap protection for a day outside when you are going to pass your camera around or have the elements flung at you. These work - OK at best. Professional eyes will say they are not much better than a sheet of glass, or so I have read in multiple UV filter comparisons.I have now read the articles about how dust, grime, (even small pieces of tape) on the front element is hardly noticeable in pictures to most people.

I will keep the filter on in daylight. If mud gets on the front it is a quick swap to another UV filter instead of cleaning(I carry 2).So yeah you get what you pay for, they do protect.. but just think when it is really needed or not.Side note - I only have 2 lenses the 18-55mm kit lens that came with my D5100 and a refurbished 55-200mm VR that I got for $130.. I really do not need to worry so much about my glass. If I spend big money on a lens and want to protect it, I will order the highest quality filters for it.

The filter works well during the day in bright light and otherwise conditions where the particular wavelength of blue-green light is not present.. When in the dark - whether setting it up for long exposures of the night sky or for birthday pictures with the candles lit up - I still have to remove the filter to avoid ghosting. However, at this price point, I don't expect the filter to handle this and it's kind of understood that I need to do this.Why buy this ? I travel a lot - with my lenses and in my experience, having an extra layer of glass over the lens in itself makes it easier to clean and one less thing to bother when considering minor spills (or people trying to check out your lenses) . When I do need that clarity, I take the lens filter off, take a picture and back on goes the filter after it's temporary housing in my back pocket.I've had previous lenses banged up (18-55 kit lenses .. in the infancy of the art) and another lens with milk shake on it (lens face down on a McD's table + clumsy skier friend = Milk shake accident ) where a UV filter has resulted in lesser pain and loss.

A UV blocking filter is only needed on a film camera. Digital sensors never see UV light. So this is a stupid accessory for filtering light. Anyway, if I spent more, I would end up with a better image, since a $50 filter from BW, for instance, gives better results. No UV filter helps the image. They all result in less contrast and less sharpness. But if you have an expensive lens, you might want to protect the front element. I do. So I put up with the slightly degraded image. This filter is cheap, and the images are still fine for me. If I was a pro, I might decide to forgo the filter and risk the front element. A lens hood such as the one on my 100mm macro keeps the front element protected pretty well, so maybe I will decide to forget the UV filter one of these days. But when I get a shiny new L series lens, I kind of don't want to expose that pretty glass to any risk. Instead, I put up with reflections, flares, and lower contrast.

Pickering,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2008","You spent a lot of money for your SLR or digital SLR camera, and then you plunked down another large chunk of cash for a quality lens. Do you really want to blow another heavy chunk of change for a basic, thread on UV filter? Well, I would normally advise that you don't skimp on quality when it comes to filters. After all, would you pay a premium price for a high performance automobile, only to fill it with watered down fuel? I should nope not! So is it such a bright idea to buy such a low cost UV filter for your high-end SLR lens? Well, maybe it is if you are considering the Tiffen 77mm UV Protection Filter.This filter does NOT offer the highest level of UV filtration, but it is rather sufficient for most conditions, and the build quality and materials used in this filter are very good. For most digital SLR users, a UV filter is a must have for protecting your lens optics, and it helps to clear up the hazy and washed out look in many of your outdoor photos. This filter has proven to clean up many of my digital photographs, and I have found almost no internal reflection artifacts. Notice I said ALMOST no internal reflection. I leave my UV filters on all of my lenses almost all of the time, and this filter has produced some minor reflection when shooting indoor photos with my Sigma 10-20mm ultra-wide angle lens. This seems to only happen when shooting in dim lighting conditions, and when aiming the lens in the direction of a strong light source, such as a table lamp. Since my Canon EOS 40D has a ""Live View"" feature that lets me see what the picture is going to look like (displayed on the 3"" LCD), I can see the reflection artifacts before I shoot the picture, and therefore have found ways to reframe my shots to avoid the reflections. However, I recommend that you simply remove the UV filter when shooting in these conditions.As I said before, I typically do not recommend buying low cost filters for your high quality lenses, but I prefer to invest my money on creative filters and not pour too much into a filter that is primarily used to simply protect the front of the lens. Many manufacturers, including Tiffen, offer higher quality UV/Haze filters for SLR lenses, and you may wish to spend the extra money if you are looking for deeper UV removal from your pictures. However, if you are looking for great lens protection and a decent level of UV filtration for a modest investment, you honestly can't go wrong with this filter. Just remember to remove the filter, or frame your shots carefully when shooting in situations where direct light reflection may be an issue.Quality = **** (4)UV Filtration = **** (4)Value = ***** (5)",Quality Lens Protection and Decent UV Filtration for Your SLR Camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase
